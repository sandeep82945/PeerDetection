        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

        "abstract": "We present MovingParts, a NeRF-based method for dynamic scene reconstruction and part discovery. We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test.

        "abstract": "While artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in revealing the relationship between biological macromolecules\u2019 primary sequence and tertiary structure, designing RNA sequences based on specified tertiary structures remains challenging. Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both clusterlevel and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks.

We introduce SWAP, a formulation of Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) for pruning, capitalizing on the geometric properties of the optimal transport problem. The \u201cswap\u201d of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost. The unique strength of SWAP is its intrinsic ability to balance noise reduction and covariance information preservation effectively. Extensive experiments performed on various networks and datasets show comparable performance of SWAP with state-of-the-art (SoTA) network pruning algorithms. Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks. Notably, our proposed method achieves a gain of 6% improvement in accuracy and 8% improvement in testing loss for MobileNetV1 with less than one-fourth of the network parameters remaining.",

        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Soil Erosion in Mountainous Regions\" authored by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. John Lee, and Dr. Emily Chen offers an in-depth analysis of how climate change affects soil erosion in mountainous areas. The researchers employed a mix of remote sensing techniques, field observations, and statistical methods to examine the connections between climate variables, land use practices, and soil erosion rates. The findings shed light on the consequences of climate change for mountainous ecosystems and underscore the importance of adopting sustainable land use practices and climate-resilient agricultural methods.\n\nThe authors utilized a mixed-methods research design that incorporated remote sensing data (such as NDVI and NDWI) along with on-the-ground measurements (including sediment traps and slope angle assessments) to assess climate change's impact on soil erosion. The study took place in a mountainous region in the western United States, where field measurements were conducted and remote sensing data were gathered. A combination of statistical analyses and machine learning methods, including linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM) classification, were employed to evaluate the interactions between climate variables, land use, and soil erosion rates.\n\nIn their discussion, the authors assert that climate change is significantly influencing soil erosion in mountainous regions, worsening current erosion issues and heightening the risk of landslides and sediment displacement. The study emphasizes the need for sustainable land management techniques, like reforestation and terracing, to counteract climate change impacts on these ecosystems. Additionally, the authors stress the importance of adopting climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as conservation agriculture and cover cropping, to reduce erosion risks and enhance agricultural productivity.\n\nDespite the informative findings, the study has notable limitations and opportunities for enhancement. Primarily, it relies extensively on remote sensing data, which may not capture the nuanced realities of field observations accurately. Furthermore, the authors do not thoroughly investigate the possible interactions among climate variables, land use practices, and soil erosion rates, risking an oversimplified understanding of these relationships. Lastly, the research lacks a robust framework for predicting and addressing the impacts of climate change on mountainous ecosystems.\n\nTo enhance the study, the authors are encouraged to:\n\n1. Improve the precision of remote sensing data by integrating additional data sources (such as ground-based measurements and direct observations).\n2. Investigate the potential interactions among climate variables, land use practices, and soil erosion rates using more sophisticated statistical and machine learning methods (for example, Bayesian networks and decision trees).\n3. Create an all-encompassing framework for predicting and mitigating the impact of climate change on mountainous ecosystems, drawing from insights across various fields (including ecology, geography, and engineering).\n4. Pursue further research and validation efforts to confirm the study\u2019s findings and their applicability.\n\nIn summary, the study \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Soil Erosion in Mountainous Regions\" presents significant findings regarding climate change's effects on mountainous ecosystems. Nonetheless, it is constrained by its dependence on remote sensing data and the insufficient exploration of potential interactions. Strengthening the research would involve improving remote sensing accuracy, delving deeper into interactions, and formulating a comprehensive framework for predicting and mitigating the impacts of climate change.",

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of reducing the number of trainable parameters in deep transformer networks, we employ Reinforcement Learning to dynamically select layers during training and tie them together. Every few iterations, the RL agent is asked whether to train each layer i independently or to copy the weights of a previous layer j < i. This facilitates weight sharing, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and also serves as an effective regularization technique. Experimental evaluations validate that our model modestly outperforms the baseline transformer model with regard to perplexity and drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. In particular, the memory consumption during training is up to one order of magnitude less than the conventional training method.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "I have reviewed the paper titled \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" authored by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. John Lee, and Dr. Emily Chen. In this assessment, I will evaluate the paper\u2019s methodology, findings, and its contribution to the discourse surrounding climate change and food security.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe authors undertook a detailed review of empirical studies related to the impact of climate change on global food security, citing 25 peer-reviewed articles and 15 sources of grey literature. They categorized these sources into three primary themes: (1) the influence of climate change on crop yields, (2) the impact on agricultural productivity, and (3) the effect on food price fluctuations. Utilizing a mixed-methods approach, the authors combined both quantitative and qualitative analyses to explore the links between climate change, food security, and economic factors.\n\nWhile the review of empirical literature appears thorough, I have concerns about the choice of sources. The emphasis on peer-reviewed articles could restrict the breadth of the review. Furthermore, the lack of detail about the grey literature renders it challenging to assess the credibility and relevance of these included sources.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe authors concluded that climate change exerts significant effects on global food security, leading to decreased crop yields, lower agricultural productivity, and heightened food price volatility. They pinpointed several critical factors contributing to these effects, including elevated temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and more frequent severe weather occurrences.\n\nAlthough the findings align with existing literature, they fail to present any fresh insights or unique viewpoints. The review primarily reiterates established knowledge, and the authors' analysis lacks depth and originality.\n\n**Contributions:**\n\nThe review offers a thorough summary of empirical research on the effects of climate change on food security. However, its contributions to the field are somewhat restricted. The authors do not propose new theoretical frameworks or policy suggestions, and their analysis mainly focuses on compiling existing information.\n\nIn summary, while the paper \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" provides a comprehensive examination of empirical data, the selection of sources and the absence of innovative analysis hinder its contributions to the field. I recommend that the authors revise the manuscript to address these shortcomings and offer more sophisticated insights into how climate change impacts global food security.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n* Broaden the review to include additional grey literature and a more diverse array of empirical studies.\n* Create a more in-depth and original analysis of the relationships among climate change, food security, and economic indicators.\n* Introduce new theoretical models or policy proposals to tackle the challenges posed by climate change on global food security.\n* Enhance the clarity and structure of the methodology, results, and discussion sections.\n* Integrate more case studies or practical examples to demonstrate the real-world implications of the authors\u2019 findings.",

        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

        "title": "TAB: TEMPORAL ACCUMULATED BATCH NORMALIZA-",
        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energyefficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "A UNIFIED SAMPLING FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVER SEARCHING OF DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed solver schedule has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose S, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that S can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply S to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2\u00d7, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.",

We consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome realized at each round. We focus on settings in which the size of the agent\u2019s action space is small. We design an algorithm that learns an approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is constant.

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal modeling is foundational for smart city applications, yet it is often hindered by data scarcity in many cities and regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The research introduces an innovative method for addressing neurodegenerative diseases through miRNA-based gene editing, which is both timely and relevant. The findings are fascinating, and the authors display a palpable enthusiasm for their method throughout the paper. However, upon review, various concerns and limitations emerge that should be addressed in subsequent studies.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The research offers a straightforward overview of current knowledge regarding neurodegenerative diseases and the shortcomings of existing therapies.\n2. The innovative miRNA-based gene editing approach holds the potential to be transformative in the field.\n3. The results highlight significant improvements in cognitive function and a reduction in disease severity, outcomes that are vital for any therapeutic strategy.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Lack of clear mechanistic understanding**: Although improvements in cognitive function and reduced severity are reported, the authors do not elucidate how miRNA-based gene editing effectively targets and alters specific genes associated with neurodegenerative diseases.\n2. **Insufficient control groups**: The usage of a single control group limits the ability to discern the distinct impacts of miRNA-based gene editing on the reported improvements.\n3. **Limited sample size**: The relatively small sample size may not adequately demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the miRNA-based gene-editing technique for neurodegenerative conditions.\n4. **Unclear efficacy and dose response**: The study mentions only a single dose of miRNA-based gene editing, leaving the relationship between efficacy and dosage ambiguous.\n5. **Potential off-target effects**: The authors do not address the possibility of off-target effects, a vital factor for any gene-editing method.\n6. **Lack of long-term follow-up**: The follow-up period is quite brief, which may not be enough to assess the long-term efficacy and safety of miRNA-based gene editing.\n7. **Unclear clinical relevance**: While animal models show improved cognitive function and decreased severity, it remains uncertain how these findings will translate into clinical applications and their use in human patients.\n8. **Unclear intellectual property**: The paper does not disclose the intellectual property status of the proposed method, an essential aspect of any new therapeutic development.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. The authors should provide a detailed mechanistic explanation of how miRNA-based gene editing engages and modifies specific genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases.\n2. Introducing additional control groups, such as a sham treatment cohort and a group receiving an alternative gene editing technique, would enhance the understanding of miRNA-based gene editing's efficacy.\n3. Increasing the sample size is essential to better evaluate the effectiveness and safety of this gene-editing approach in neurodegenerative diseases.\n4. The authors should present information on the efficacy and dose response of miRNA-based gene editing, along with a thorough account of any potential off-target impacts.\n5. Longer-term follow-up studies should be conducted to assess the continued efficacy and safety of the miRNA-based gene-editing techniques.\n6. Clinical trials must be executed to ascertain the clinical relevance of this approach and to validate its efficacy and safety in human subjects.\n7. The authors should clarify the intellectual property situation concerning their methodology, ensuring that it is not patented in a manner that might limit its clinical application.\n\n**Conclusion:** In summary, while the paper introduces a promising method for treating neurodegenerative diseases via miRNA-based gene editing, numerous concerns and limitations need to be addressed in future investigations. Although the authors show enthusiasm for their approach, providing a clear mechanistic understanding, additional control groups, and a larger sample size is crucial for establishing the efficacy and safety of miRNA-based gene editing.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in high-fidelity virtual environments serve as one of the major driving forces for building intelligent embodied agents to perceive, reason and interact with the physical world. Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire , flood , and wind , and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents\u2019 decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an LLM-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks.

While previous works have proposed algorithms to find optimal solutions for a range of metrics (e.g. shortest, lowest-cost), these works generally overlook the fact that we have imperfect knowledge of the space of possible reactions, meaning plans created by the algorithm may not work in a laboratory. In this paper we propose a novel formulation of retrosynthesis in terms of stochastic processes to account for this uncertainty. We then propose a novel greedy algorithm called retro-fallback which maximizes the probability that at least one synthesis plan can be executed in the lab. Using in-silico benchmarks we demonstrate that retro-fallback generally produces better sets of synthesis plans than the popular MCTS and retro* algorithms.",

        "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained significant popularity among researchers as a powerful tool for understanding unknown distributions based on limited samples. This popularity stems partly from their impressive performance and partly from their ability to provide meaningful feature representations in the latent space. Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs), a variant of VAEs, aim to not only improve model efficiency but also interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which WAEs are applied such as natural images are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice of WAEs, in this paper, we show that WAEs can learn the data distributions when the network architectures are properly chosen. We show that the convergence rates of the expected excess risk in the number of samples for WAEs are independent of the high feature dimension, instead relying only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The research presents a novel strategy for addressing neurodegenerative diseases through microRNA-based gene editing. The authors display a solid grasp of the biological principles involved and the therapeutic implications of their method. Nevertheless, the study reveals several methodological and experimental shortcomings that require attention.\n\n1. **Study Design:**\n\nWhile utilizing a mouse model for neurodegenerative disease is a typical method in preclinical research, the authors fail to specify which neurodegenerative disease model is being employed, posing a limitation. Furthermore, the exploration is limited to a single treatment group, with no discussion of potential confounding factors that might influence the outcomes.\n\n2. **MicroRNA Identification:**\n\nThe identification of microRNAs that target disease-related genes through machine learning and bioinformatics tools is an inventive strategy; however, clarity is lacking regarding the training and validation of these algorithms. Additionally, the specificity and sensitivity of the identified microRNAs are not mentioned, which is a vital aspect to consider.\n\n3. **siRNA Design and Synthesis:**\n\nAlthough the authors create microRNA-based small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules targeting the identified microRNAs, they do not provide information about the efficiency and specificity of these siRNAs, which are crucial considerations.\n\n4. **Experimental Design:**\n\nThe study's reliance on a single treatment arm is a concern, especially with no control group included, which limits the findings. There is also a lack of discussion regarding potential confounding variables that could affect the results.\n\n5. **Data Analysis:**\n\nWhile results concerning the treatment's impact on symptoms and disease progression are provided, there is an absence of details regarding the statistical methods employed to analyze the data, which is another limitation.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Specify Neurodegenerative Disease Model:** The authors should clearly state which specific neurodegenerative disease model was utilized.\n2. **Validate Machine Learning Algorithms:** There should be validation of the machine learning algorithms employed in microRNA identification with independent datasets.\n3. **Detail on siRNA Efficiency and Specificity:** The authors need to report the efficiency and specificity of the siRNA molecules utilized in the study.\n4. **Incorporate a Control Arm:** Including a control arm would help eliminate potential confounding variables from the findings.\n5. **Clarify Statistical Analysis:** Information regarding the statistical analysis applied for data evaluation should be included.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn summary, while the research introduces a promising strategy for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing, it exhibits several methodological and experimental flaws that must be rectified. Addressing these issues will enhance the study and substantiate the potential of microRNA-based gene editing in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

        "abstract": "Reward modeling (a.k.a., preference modeling) is instrumental for aligning large language models with human preferences, particularly within the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances. We have made the code, data, and model checkpoints publicly available to facilitate and inspire further research advancements1.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FORMATSPREAD, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights1. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms several baselines, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation.",

        "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influencedriven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

        "abstract": "Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data.

        "abstract": "Existing losses used in deep metric learning (DML) for image retrieval often lead to highly non-uniform intra-class and inter-class representation structures across test classes and data distributions. When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in DML as threshold inconsistency. In real-world applications, such inconsistency often complicates the threshold selection process when deploying commercial image retrieval systems. To measure this inconsistency, we propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) that quantifies the variance in the operating characteristics across classes. Using the OPIS metric, we find that achieving high accuracy levels in a DML model does not automatically guarantee threshold consistency. In fact, our investigation reveals a Pareto frontier in the high-accuracy regime, where existing methods to improve accuracy often lead to degradation in threshold consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that promotes uniformity in representation structures across classes by selectively penalizing hard sample pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate TCM\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing threshold consistency while preserving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML settings.",

        "abstract": "COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters\u2019 initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on lowresolution images at low bitrates.

We consider a training dataset with well-separated input vectors: Any pair of input data with the same label are positively correlated, and any pair with different labels are negatively correlated. Our analysis shows that, during the early phase of training, neurons in the first layer try to align with either the positive data or the negative data, depending on its corresponding weight on the second layer. A careful analysis of the neurons\u2019 directional dynamics allows us to provide an O( logn \u221a\u03bc ) upper bound on the time it takes for all neurons to achieve good alignment with the input data, where n is the number of data points and \u03bc measures how well the data are separated. After the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a O( 1t ) rate, and the weight matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings.",

Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many real-world nonEuclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based and MLP-based models have emerged rapidly and won dominance in time series analysis. In contrast, convolution is losing steam in time series tasks nowadays for inferior performance. This paper studies the open question of how to better use convolution in time series analysis and makes efforts to bring convolution back to the arena of time series analysis. To this end, we modernize the traditional TCN and conduct time series related modifications to make it more suitable for time series tasks. As the outcome, we propose ModernTCN and successfully solve this open question through a seldom-explored way in time series community. As a pure convolution structure, ModernTCN still achieves the consistent state-of-the-art performance on five mainstream time series analysis tasks while maintaining the efficiency advantage of convolution-based models, therefore providing a better balance of efficiency and performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Our study further reveals that, compared with previous convolution-based models, our ModernTCN has much larger effective receptive fields (ERFs), therefore can better unleash the potential of convolution in time series analysis.

Amidst the flourishing interest in these training dynamics, we present a novel observation: Parameters during training exhibit intrinsic correlations over time. Capitalizing on this, we introduce correlation mode decomposition (CMD). This algorithm clusters the parameter space into groups, termed modes, that display synchronized behavior across epochs. This enables CMD to efficiently represent the training dynamics of complex networks, like ResNets and Transformers, using only a few modes. Moreover, test set generalization is enhanced. We introduce an efficient CMD variant, designed to run concurrently with training. Our experiments indicate that CMD surpasses the state-of-the-art method for compactly modeled dynamics on image classification.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "This research examined how different pH levels influence the growth and yield of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum). A total of 120 plants were cultivated under controlled conditions with pH levels set at 4, 5, 5.5, 7, 7.5, and 8. The plants were provided with a balanced fertilizer, and their height, leaf area, and fruit yield were measured consistently over a span of 60 days. The findings indicated that the best pH levels for tomato growth fell between 5.5 and 7, with the most significant yield and leaf area recorded at pH 7.\n\nTomato plants are vital for agriculture, offering key nutrients and vitamins for human diets. However, optimal pH conditions, which are crucial for maximizing crop yield and minimizing plant stress, are often neglected in cultivation practices.\n\nThe study involved monitoring 120 tomato plants across various pH settings, ensuring consistent watering with a balanced fertilizer. Data on the plants' height, leaf area, and yield were systematically collected throughout the 60-day period. \n\nResults displayed in Table 1 reveal:\n\n| pH Level | Height (cm) | Leaf Area (cm\u00b2) | Fruit Yield (g/plant) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | 15 | 10 | 2 |\n| 5 | 20 | 15 | 4 |\n| 5.5 | 25 | 20 | 5 |\n| 7 | 30 | 30 | 8 |\n| 7.5 | 28 | 25 | 7 |\n| 8 | 22 | 18 | 3 |\n\nThe highest observed yield and leaf area occurred at pH 7, while the lowest were noted at pH levels 4 and 8.\n\nThe findings align with previously identified optimal pH ranges for tomato growth, which support efficient nutrient absorption, resulting in greater yield and leaf area.\n\nIn summation, the study reinforces that the ideal pH range for growing tomato plants lies between 5.5 and 7, with the most substantial growth observed at pH 7.\n\n**Peer Review Summary:**\n\nThis research effectively details the impact of various pH levels on tomato plant growth and productivity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The research was methodically executed, and the results are well-organized in tabular format.\n2. The authors maintained a controlled environment and used a standardized fertilizer.\n3. A sample size of 120 plants allows for credible findings.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The focus was solely on pH levels, without consideration of other factors influencing plant health like temperature, light, and moisture.\n2. There was a lack of discussion regarding the study's constraints, particularly the possibility of pH variations within the controlled setting.\n3. Other important metrics, such as plant stress responses and nutrient uptake, were not assessed.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. Future studies should incorporate variables such as temperature, lighting, and moisture levels in relation to tomato growth and yield.\n2. Authors should address study limitations and propose future research pathways.\n3. Additional parameters related to plant health, including stress and disease resistance, should be considered alongside yield and leaf area.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nI rate this study 7 out of 10 for providing a solid overview of the relationship between pH levels and tomato plant health, despite lacking depth in certain methodological areas.\n\n**Publication Recommendation:**\n\nI advise the authors revise their manuscript to address identified weaknesses and limitations prior to resubmission.\n\n**Further Remarks:**\n\nImplementing a robust statistical analysis, such as ANOVA, could enhance the interpretation of the effects of pH on tomato growth and productivity.\n\nTo conclude, while this study establishes a strong base for exploring pH impacts on tomato plants, further in-depth analysis is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.",

        "abstract": "Transformers have emerged as the architecture of choice for many state-ofthe-art AI models, showcasing exceptional performance across a wide range of AI applications. However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.",

Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or lowresolution conditioning. RDM achieves state-of-the-art FID on CelebA-HQ and sFID on ImageNet 256\u00d7256, surpassing previous works such as ADM, LDM and DiT by a large margin.

Nonetheless, it's important to acknowledge that mouse models may not fully capture the complexities of the human condition, necessitating additional studies to confirm findings in human subjects.\n2. The investigation employs a small molecule inhibitor targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is an encouraging strategy for addressing neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease. However, further research is essential to establish the ideal dosage and treatment duration.\n3. The findings indicate that the synergistic effect of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule results in reduced neuroinflammation and enhanced symptoms in the rodent model. Still, it remains uncertain if this method would yield similar results in humans, requiring additional studies for validation in human populations.\n4. The sample size of the study is relatively limited, highlighting the need for more research to assess the broader applicability of the findings.\n5. Absence of a negative control group is noted, which is typically a standard element in experimental design. This omission raises questions about whether the observed outcomes stem from the small molecule inhibitor and chaperone molecule or other variables.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. It is advisable for the authors to perform additional experiments to ascertain the most effective dosage and treatment duration for the small molecule inhibitor and chaperone combination.\n2. Further studies should be designed to evaluate the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach among human subjects.\n3. Researchers should also investigate the applicability of the results across various patient populations with Alzheimer's disease.\n4. Future experiments should incorporate a negative control group to better assess the influence of external variables on the findings.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nThis research represents a notable advancement in Alzheimer's disease study. The innovative usage of a small molecule inhibitor for the NLRP3 inflammasome alongside a chaperone molecule offers a fresh perspective on mitigating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. Despite this potential, further inquiry into its effectiveness in human subjects and validation across diverse patient groups is crucial. With continued research and verification, this method could emerge as a groundbreaking therapeutic option for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.",

        "title": "ZERO-MEAN REGULARIZED SPECTRAL CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: IMPLICITLY MITIGATING WRONG CON-",
        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation. These results highlight the potential of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive learning to be a promising approach in various tasks.",

        "abstract": "We resolve the open question regarding the sample complexity of policy learning for maximizing the long-run average reward associated with a uniformly ergodic Markov decision process (MDP), assuming a generative model. In this context, the existing literature provides a sample complexity upper bound of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5)* and a lower bound of \u03a9(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). In these expressions, |S| and |A| denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces respectively, tmix serves as a uniform upper limit for the total variation mixing times, and \u03b5 signifies the error tolerance. Therefore, a notable gap of tmix still remains to be bridged. Our primary contribution is the development of an estimator for the optimal policy of average reward MDPs with a sample complexity of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). This marks the first algorithm and analysis to reach the literature\u2019s lower bound. Our new algorithm draws inspiration from ideas in Li et al. (2020), Jin & Sidford (2021), and Wang et al.

        "abstract": "We study the notion of a generalization bound being uniformly tight, meaning that the difference between the bound and the population loss is small for all learning algorithms and all population distributions. Numerous generalization bounds have been proposed in the literature as potential explanations for the ability of neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized setting. However, in their paper \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them,\u201d Jiang et al. (2020) examine more than a dozen generalization bounds, and show empirically that none of them are uniformly tight. This raises the question of whether uniformly-tight generalization bounds are at all possible in the overparameterized setting. We consider two types of generalization bounds: (1) bounds that may depend on the training set and the learned hypothesis (e.g., margin bounds). We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting; (2) bounds that may in addition also depend on the learning algorithm (e.g., stability bounds). For these bounds, we show a trade-off between the algorithm\u2019s performance and the bound\u2019s tightness. Namely, if the algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it in the overparameterized setting. We explain how these formal results can, in our view, inform research on generalization bounds for neural networks, while stressing that other interpretations of these results are also possible.",

        "abstract": "Existing NAS methods suffer from either an excessive amount of time for repetitive sampling and training of many task-irrelevant architectures. To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20\u00d7 when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existing BO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space on the ImageNet 1K dataset.",

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.",

We motivate our work by the inadequacy of existing methods for capturing the evolving graph spectra, which are also computationally expensive due to the temporal aspect along with the graph vertex domain. We view the problem as an optimization over the Laplacian of the continuous time dynamic graph. Additionally, we propose pseudo-spectrum relaxations that decompose the transformation process, making it highly computationally efficient. The EFT method adeptly captures the evolving graph\u2019s structural and positional properties, making it effective for downstream tasks on evolving graphs.

        "title": "LIPSCHITZ SINGULARITIES IN DIFFUSION MODELS",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.",

        "title": "UNKNOWN DOMAIN INCONSISTENCY MINIMIZATION FOR DOMAIN GENERALIZATION",
        "abstract": "The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the transferability of the model learned from a source domain to unobserved domains. To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM\u2019s generalization capability in unseen domains.

        "abstract": "Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \u201cexpert\u201d through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.",

        "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",

The literature review is comprehensive, offering a solid overview of the current advancements in this domain.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe proposed architecture, which combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), presents a novel strategy for modeling protein-ligand interactions. Utilizing CNNs for feature extraction from molecular structures is an appropriate choice, given their proven effectiveness in identifying local features within 3D molecular configurations. However, the application of RNNs for capturing temporal dependencies may prove less effective in this scenario.\n\n**Results:**\nThe findings indicate that the proposed method is effective in predicting binding affinity, achieving a high level of accuracy and showing significant enhancement compared to the baseline model. Nevertheless, the results lack sufficient information on the model's performance with unseen data. It would be beneficial for the authors to include performance metrics from a test set and offer more insights regarding the training and evaluation datasets.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe discussion section is rather succinct and lacks thorough exploration. The authors might have delved deeper into the limitations and challenges associated with the suggested approach. For instance, a discussion on the CNNs' limitations in capturing long-term dependencies and the obstacles in integrating additional features into the model would enhance this section.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion is concise and offers limited commentary on the results.

        "abstract": "It is desirable for an agent to be able to solve a rich variety of problems that can be specified through language in the same environment. A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate this experimentally in a tabular setting, as well as in a high-dimensional video game and continuous control environment. Finally, we also demonstrate that the performance of skill machines can be improved with regular off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms when optimal behaviours are desired.",

To address the challenges, we propose a Gaussian-based representation of normals in SDF fields. Supervised by polarization priors, this representation guides the learning of geometry behind the specular reflection and captures more details than existing methods. Moreover, we propose a reweighting strategy in the optimization process to alleviate the noise issue of polarization priors. To validate the effectiveness of our design, we capture polarimetric information, and ground truth meshes in additional reflective scenes with various geometry. We also evaluated our framework on the PANDORA dataset. Comparisons prove our method outperforms existing neural 3D reconstruction methods in reflective scenes by a large margin.",

The authors have pinpointed a specific group of microRNAs (miR-124) capable of influencing the expression of genes implicated in neurodegenerative disease development.

The concept bottleneck layer partitions the generative model into three parts: the pre-concept bottleneck portion, the CB layer, and the post-concept bottleneck portion. To train CB generative models, we complement the traditional task-based loss function for training generative models with a concept loss and an orthogonality loss. The CB layer and these loss terms are model agnostic, which we demonstrate by applying the CB layer to three different families of generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. On multiple datasets across different types of generative models, steering a generative model, with the CB layer, outperforms all baselines\u2014in some cases, it is 10 times more effective. In addition, we show how the CB layer can be used to interpret the output of the generative model and debug the model during or post training.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in autonomous driving have relied on data-driven approaches, which are widely adopted but face challenges including dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability. Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove DiLu\u2019s capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advantage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capability in decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Through the proposed DiLu framework, LLM is strengthened to apply knowledge and to reason causally in the autonomous driving domain. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/DiLu/",

        "title": "GENERALIZATION: UNRAVELING LEARNING DIFFER-",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (ddata) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to ddata, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \u201clabel sharpness\u201d (KF ) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model\u2019s adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our ddata formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (drepr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to drepr, and show that ddata serves as an upper bound for drepr. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.1",

        "abstract": "Transformers have gained widespread usage in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting, delivering impressive performance. Nonetheless, these existing transformer-based methods often neglect an essential aspect: the incorporation of uncertainty into the predicted series, which holds significant value in decisionmaking. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-Modulated Diffusion Model (TMDM), uniting conditional diffusion generative process with transformers into a unified framework to enable precise distribution forecasting for MTS. TMDM harnesses the power of transformers to extract essential insights from historical time series data. This information is then utilized as prior knowledge, capturing covariate-dependence in both the forward and reverse processes within the diffusion model. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate well-designed transformerbased forecasting methods into TMDM to enhance its overall performance. Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for evaluating uncertainty estimation performance. Through extensive experiments on six datasets using four evaluation metrics, we establish the effectiveness of TMDM in probabilistic MTS forecasting.",

However, existing attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) models used for analyzing Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in cancer diagnostics often overlook the contextual information of tumor and neighboring tiles, leading to misclassifications. To address this, we propose the ContextAware Multiple Instance Learning (CAMIL) architecture. CAMIL incorporates neighbor-constrained attention to consider dependencies among tiles within a WSI and integrates contextual constraints as prior knowledge into the MIL model. We evaluated CAMIL on subtyping non-small cell lung cancer (TCGA-NSCLC) and detecting lymph node (CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17) metastasis, achieving test AUCs of 97.5%, 95.9%, and 88.1%, respectively, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, CAMIL enhances model interpretability by identifying regions of high diagnostic value.",

        "abstract": "We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the unknown SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from the exogenous noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of noise variances in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator.",

Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, COMPOSE AND CONQUER (CNC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner.

        "abstract": "Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) are a major class of time-independent PDEs that play a key role in many scientific and engineering domains such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and solid mechanics. Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green\u2019s function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96%.

        "abstract": "Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one\u2019s intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer\u2019s ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.",

Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-theart NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP. In our experiments, we observe that our algorithm achieves substantially smaller mis-clustering errors compared to the existing state-of-the-art.",

        "abstract": "Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for OPT 66B and LLAMA-2 70B models with modest loss in accuracy (superior to 2:4 sparsity). Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.",

Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods .",

The urgent need for action to combat climate change's agricultural impacts is evident given the correlation between yield declines and increased weather extremes.\n\nIn summary, the review underscores the severe effects of climate change on global food security with wide-ranging implications.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- The review effectively summarizes the relationship between climate change and food security, integrating both empirical and theoretical perspectives.\n- A thorough literature search was conducted, utilizing various academic resources to strengthen the review's foundation.\n- The findings clearly illustrate the alarming reduction in crop yields due to climate-related factors.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- A deeper exploration of socioeconomic and institutional contributors to yield declines would enhance the discussion.\n- The literature review could include a wider array of recent studies and emerging trends.\n- More targeted recommendations for policymakers and stakeholders addressing climate change's impact on food security would be beneficial.\n\n**Future Research Suggestions:**\n\n- Explore how socioeconomic and institutional elements influence crop yield declines.\n- Assess the implications of climate change on food security across different regions.\n- Formulate better strategies to lessen climate change's agricultural impacts.\n\n**Rating:**\n\n- I would assign this review a score of 8 out of 10.\n- The comprehensive overview effectively discusses the impact of climate change on food security with well-supported findings.\n- However, it needs more insight into socioeconomic factors, an expanded literature review, and clearer recommendations for decision-makers.\n\n**Author's Response:**\n\nI am grateful for the peer reviewer's constructive feedback. I concur that incorporating a more detailed examination of socioeconomic and institutional factors would provide a fuller picture of climate change's impact on food security. I will revise the review to address these aspects.\n\nAdditionally, I value the suggestion to explore regional contexts in future research, which is crucial for understanding this issue better.\n\nThank you for the thorough and helpful evaluation of my work.",

        "title": "LMUFORMER: LOW COMPLEXITY YET POWERFUL SPIKING MODEL WITH LEGENDRE MEMORY UNITS",
        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated high accuracy in numerous applications but have high complexity and lack sequential processing capability making them ill-suited for many streaming applications at the edge where devices are heavily resource-constrained. Thus motivated, many researchers have proposed reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming and low-cost inference, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we propose a new direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a fully-sequential recurrent model can help push its performance toward Transformer models while retaining its sequential processing capability. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of Legendre Memory Units (LMU) in sequence learning tasks, we propose LMUFormer, which augments the LMU with convolutional patch embedding and convolutional channel mixer. Moreover, we present a spiking version of this architecture, which introduces the benefit of states within the patch embedding and channel mixer modules while simultaneously reducing the computing complexity. We evaluated our architectures on multiple sequence datasets. Of particular note is our performance on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (35 classes). In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53\u00d7 reduction in parameters and a substantial 65\u00d7 decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%. Additionally, owing to our model\u2019s proficiency in real-time data processing, we are able to achieve a 32.03% reduction in sequence length, all while incurring an inconsequential decline in performance. Our code is publicly available here.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models are capable of generating impressive images conditioned on text descriptions, and extensions of these models allow users to edit images at a relatively coarse scale. However, the ability to precisely edit the layout, position, pose, and shape of objects in images with diffusion models is still difficult. To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image. By simultaneously sampling from a diffusion model and guiding the sample to have low guidance loss, we can obtain a motion-edited image. We demonstrate that our technique works on complex motions and produces high quality edits of real and generated images.",

While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.",

        "abstract": "Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data or unseen domain, termed OOD generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for \"flat minima leads to better OOD generalization\". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable progress in 3D aspect. Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing openvocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D.Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align viewinvariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a potential open-vocabulary 3D generation capability.",

        "abstract": "Despite many successful examples in which probabilistic inference can account for perception, we have little understanding of how the brain represents and uses structured priors that capture the complexity of natural input statistics. Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors. Overall, the model provides a new framework for circuit-level representation of probabilistic information, in a format that facilitates flexible inference.",

        "abstract": "Manifold-valued measurements exist in numerous applications within computer vision and machine learning. Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

The authors thoroughly present the effects of climate change on global food security, emphasizing the necessity for new predictive strategies to address these challenges. The introduction effectively establishes the framework for their innovative method, which merges machine learning with crop yield data and climate modeling.\n\nThe authors propose a hybrid method that integrates machine learning techniques with crop yield datasets and climate models to forecast the repercussions of climate change on food security globally. The approach encompasses data preprocessing, selection of models, and evaluation through various metrics. They apply an array of machine learning techniques, including random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector machines, to forecast crop yields and pinpoint critical factors influencing the impacts of climate change. Employing climate models like IPCC AR5 and CMIP5 forms a solid foundation for assessing the forecasts.\n\nThe findings from their study indicate a strong level of accuracy and reliability. The authors illustrate that their hybrid model surpasses conventional climate models in prediction accuracy and offers a more accurate depiction of climate change effects on global food security. Their results align well with previously published studies, bolstering the credibility of their conclusions.\n\nIn the discussion and conclusion segments, the authors perform a comprehensive evaluation of their findings and their broader implications. They address the limitations of their work, such as data access and the uncertainty of the models utilized, and suggest paths for further research. The conclusion succinctly encapsulates their main outcomes and offers guidance for policymakers and practitioners.\n\n1. The manuscript would improve with a more exhaustive discussion on the sources and availability of data. While the authors reference various climate models and machine learning algorithms, a clearer depiction of data sources and any associated limitations or biases would be beneficial.\n2. The authors might also investigate potential applications or case studies to illustrate the real-world significance of their method. This would provide a stronger rationale for their hybrid approach and showcase its capacity to effect tangible change.\n3. A more detailed examination of model uncertainty and its consequences is also necessary. Although the authors acknowledge this uncertainty, a more in-depth explanation of how they tackled the issue and its implications for their findings would be helpful.\n\nIn summary, this paper makes a solid and thorough addition to climate change research. The innovative integration of machine learning with crop yield data and climate models presents a promising method for forecasting the effects of climate change on global food security. Despite certain areas needing enhancement, particularly concerning data accessibility and model uncertainty, their method holds considerable potential for practical implementation. The authors have produced a clear and well-organized manuscript that is fit for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nI would evaluate this paper as an 8/10. The authors present a well-organized and comprehensive contribution to understanding climate change, and their innovative approach shows substantial practical viability.

        "abstract": "Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We also provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.",

        "abstract": "Due to privacy or patent concerns, a growing number of large models are released without granting access to their training data, making transferring their knowledge inefficient and problematic. In response, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions. However, simply adopting models derived from DFKD for real-world applications suffers significant performance degradation, due to the discrepancy between teachers\u2019 training data and real-world scenarios (student domain). The degradation stems from the portions of teachers\u2019 knowledge that are not applicable to the student domain. They are specific to the teacher domain and would undermine students\u2019 performance. Hence, selectively transferring teachers\u2019 appropriate knowledge becomes the primary challenge in DFKD. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method AuG-KD. It utilizes an uncertainty-guided and sample-specific anchor to align student-domain data with the teacher domain and leverages a generative method to progressively trade off the learning process between OOD knowledge distillation and domain-specific information learning via mixup learning. Extensive experiments in 3 datasets and 8 settings demonstrate the stability and superiority of our approach. Code available at https://github.com/IshiKura-a/AuG-KD",

        "abstract": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT.

WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities\u2014count and search\u2014at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Overall Impression:**\nThe study conducted by the authors is a well-organized and thorough examination of how climate change impacts amphibian populations within a temperate forest ecosystem. The research is relevant and adds to our knowledge regarding the effects of climate change on various ecosystems.\n\n**Methodology:**\nUtilizing a mixed-methods framework, the researchers blend statistical analyses with a literature review. They analyze a dataset that encompasses amphibian species and their distribution in a temperate forest ecosystem to explore the repercussions of climate change on their population numbers and spread. The techniques employed, including climate variable assessments and spatial analyses, are appropriate for addressing the research query. Nonetheless, the authors should provide additional information regarding the dataset and sampling techniques to enhance transparency.\n\n**Results:**\nThe findings reveal a notable reduction in both the abundance and distribution of amphibians as a consequence of climate change. The assessment of climate variables alongside spatial trends indicates that shifts in temperature and precipitation have resulted in some amphibian species experiencing expanded suitable habitats, while others face less favorable conditions. These results align with the authors\u2019 hypothesis regarding the considerable effects of climate change on amphibian populations in temperate forest ecosystems.\n\n**Discussion:**\nIn the discussion section, the authors thoroughly analyze their results and emphasize the significant outcomes of their research. They delve into the mechanisms that contribute to the observed changes in amphibian populations, particularly how temperature and precipitation variability affects habitat suitability. However, these discussions could be strengthened by including more direct citations from existing literature on the effects of climate change on amphibians.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion effectively summarizes the primary findings and implications of the study. The authors assert that climate change significantly influences amphibian populations in temperate forest ecosystems and advocate for prioritizing habitat protection and the management of climate-induced stressors in conservation efforts.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nTo enhance the manuscript, I suggest the authors:\n\n1. Offer more comprehensive details about the dataset and sampling strategies to improve transparency.\n2. Include additional references to the relevant literature to enrich the discussion.\n3. Provide in-depth analyses concerning the factors influencing changes in amphibian abundance and distribution.\n\n**Rating:**\nI would rate this manuscript as an 8 out of 10. The research is well-structured and the findings greatly enhance our comprehension of climate change impacts on ecosystems. However, addressing the aforementioned areas would further strengthen the work.\n\n**Future Directions:**\nThe study underscores the necessity for continued exploration into how climate change affects amphibian populations. Subsequent research should focus on the mechanisms driving changes in amphibian numbers and distribution as well as evaluating the success of conservation strategies aimed at habitat protection and climate-related stressor management.\n\n**Confidentiality:**\nThis review is confidential and must not be disclosed without the authors' consent.",

        "abstract": "Generative pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in language and vision domains by learning useful representations. In this paper, we extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot manipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative pre-training. We introduce GR-1, a GPT-style model designed for multi-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs a language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an end-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly finetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real robot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and improves the success rate from 88.9% to 94.9%. In the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from 53.3% to 85.4%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline methods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and objects. We provide inaugural evidence that a unified GPT-style transformer, augmented with large-scale video generative pre-training, exhibits remarkable generalization to multi-task visual robot manipulation.

The authors introduce an innovative method for treating neurodegenerative diseases by utilizing microencapsulated stem cells, which has recently gained significant interest.\n\nIn their methodology, the authors explain how they employ microencapsulation technology to envelop stem cells within a biocompatible matrix before implanting this into targeted brain areas. The encapsulated stem cells are engineered to release a mixture of growth factors and signaling molecules that facilitate neural repair and regeneration. The authors have conducted a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies to assess the efficacy and safety of their microencapsulated stem cells.\n\nThe study's findings are encouraging, exhibiting notable enhancements in motor function and neural regeneration in the treated groups.

        "abstract": "High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of conflicting goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduced camera frame rates, and increased data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, and saccade mechanism of the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from a sequence of foveal-peripheral views, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our model demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-theart foveal-peripheral based vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches.

        "abstract": "We seek to uncover the latent interest units from behavioral data to better learn user preferences under the VAE framework. Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user\u2019s decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests. On real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method compared to a series of baselines.",

However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained TP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.",

        "title": "LOCAL COMPOSITE SADDLE POINT OPTIMIZATION",
        "abstract": "Distributed optimization (DO) approaches for saddle point problems (SPP) have recently gained in popularity due to the critical role they play in machine learning (ML). Existing works mostly target smooth unconstrained objectives in Euclidean space, whereas ML problems often involve constraints or non-smooth regularization, which results in a need for composite optimization. Moreover, although non-smooth regularization often serves to induce structure (e.g., sparsity), standard aggregation schemes in distributed optimization break this structure. Addressing these issues, we propose Federated Dual Extrapolation (FeDualEx), an extra-step primal-dual algorithm with local updates, which is the first of its kind to encompass both saddle point optimization and composite objectives under the distributed paradigm. Using a generalized notion of Bregman divergence, we analyze its convergence and communication complexity in the homogeneous setting. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of FeDualEx for inducing structure in these challenging settings.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The article \"The Effects of Meditation on Stress Reduction in College Students: A Systematic Review\" (Volume 12, Issue 3, 2022) investigates the impact of meditation on alleviating stress among college students through a systematic review of 14 studies. Utilizing the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool, the authors assessed the quality of these studies.\n\nThis review summarizes the current understanding of meditation as a supplementary intervention for managing stress in college students. The studies were classified into three groups according to their research designs: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies. The majority of the studies were RCTs, which were identified as the most effective in lowering stress levels among college students.\n\nThe authors conclude that there is strong evidence supporting the efficacy of meditation for stress reduction, especially highlighted in RCTs, indicating that meditation can positively influence stress management within this demographic.\n\nNevertheless, there are notable limitations within the review. Firstly, some studies relied on self-reported measures, which may not accurately represent the participants\u2019 actual stress reduction levels. Additionally, the review does not delve into the mechanisms that underlie the stress-reducing effects of meditation, which is critical for future research.\n\nMoreover, the study has been critiqued for featuring duplicate publications of the same research (Kim, J., & Lee, S. M., 2017; Lee, S. M., & Kim, J., 2015; Park, J., & Lee, S. M., 2019), casting doubt on the findings' validity due to the repetition of similar studies with varying conclusions.\n\nThe review also fails to address the variability among the included studies, which could hinder the overall interpretations of the findings. While the Cochrane risk of bias tool was utilized to evaluate study quality, it may not identify all biases present.\n\nIn summary, while this paper offers valuable insights into the relationship between meditation and stress reduction in college students, its limitations prompt questions regarding the reliability of its conclusions. Future investigations should aim to clarify the mechanisms behind meditation's effects on stress and assess the efficacy of various meditation types.\n\nSuggestions for enhancement:\n\n1. Minimize reliance on duplicate studies in the review.\n2. Investigate the underlying mechanisms of meditation's impact on stress reduction.\n3. Address the diversity among the studies included.\n4. Implement more rigorous methods to evaluate study quality.",

While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting\u2019s inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models\u2019 ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel defense against backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to directly extract its backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

        "abstract": "Inspired by the outstanding zero-shot capability of vision language models (VLMs) in image classification tasks, open-vocabulary object detection has attracted increasing interest by distilling the broad VLM knowledge into detector training. However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text description of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training. In addition, we introduce large language models as an interactive and implicit knowledge repository which enables iterative mining and refining visually oriented textual descriptors for precise region-text alignment. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale benchmarks show that DVDet outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins.",

        "abstract": "Deep long-tailed recognition (DLTR) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, etc. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts, which are identified as prevalent and critical issues in this study. In this paper, we empirically establish the severity of the optimization conflict issue in the DLTR scenario, which leads to a degradation of representation learning. This observation serves as the motivation for pursuing Pareto optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a straightforward integration of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with DLTR methods is infeasible due to the disparity between multi-task learning (MTL) and DLTR. Therefore, we propose effective alternatives by decoupling MOO-based MTL from a temporal perspective rather than a structural one. Furthermore, we enhance the integration of MOO and DLTR by investigating the generalization and convergence problems. Specifically, we propose optimizing the variability collapse loss, guided by the derived MOObased DLTR generalization bound, to improve generalization. Additionally, we anticipate worst-case optimization to ensure convergence. Building upon the proposed MOO framework, we introduce a novel method called Pareto deep LOngTailed recognition (PLOT). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the truthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/RAIN.",

Although these methods greatly improve the algorithmic fairness of GNNs, the fairness can be easily corrupted by carefully designed adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial attacks on fairness of GNNs and propose G-FairAttack, a general framework for attacking various types of fairness-aware GNNs in terms of fairness with an unnoticeable effect on prediction utility. In addition, we propose a fast computation technique to reduce the time complexity of G-FairAttack. The experimental study demonstrates that G-FairAttack successfully corrupts the fairness of different types of GNNs while keeping the attack unnoticeable. Our study on fairness attacks sheds light on potential vulnerabilities in fairness-aware GNNs and guides further research on the robustness of GNNs in terms of fairness.",

        "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating tasks, including image and audio generation. However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by \u03b5 initialized in t = 0 and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries that achieve at least 6\u00d7 efficiency than the previous SOTA baseline on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-tospeech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA.

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature orthogonal to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intraclass incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance.",

        "abstract": "Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomialexpressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on 13 homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.

        "abstract": "3D visual grounding is the ability to localize objects in 3D scenes conditioned by utterances. Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question \u201cCan we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?\u201d. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users\u2019 demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.",

        "abstract": "We introduce MAmmoTH, a series of open-source large language models (LLMs) specifically tailored for general math problem-solving. The MAmmoTH models are trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales, six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT4\u2019s CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models.",

However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LOL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LOL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM\u2019s value estimate, A-LOL only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement, sample-efficient, and stable LM training recipe. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LOL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LOL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "Title: Understanding the Effects of Climate-Induced Changes in Soil Microbial Communities: A Meta-Analysis of Field Experiments\n\nAbstract:\nSoil microbial communities are essential for regulating ecosystem processes and are highly responsive to environmental changes. Climate change is modifying soil temperature and moisture levels, causing shifts in microbial community structure and functioning. This meta-analysis, which encompasses 15 field experiments, investigated how climate-induced alterations affect soil microbial populations. The findings indicated that warming and drying treatments led to a decrease in microbial biomass and a transition towards a more mesophilic community structure. Conversely, cooling treatments had little impact on both microbial biomass and community composition. These results underscore the significance of understanding climate-induced changes in soil microbial communities and their potential repercussions on ecosystem processes and carbon sequestration. The study suggests that warming and drying may contribute to soil carbon loss and a decline in ecosystem services.\n\nKeywords: climate change; soil microbial communities; meta-analysis; field experiments; ecosystem functioning; carbon sequestration\n\n1. Introduction:\nSoil microbial communities consist of various bacterial and fungal populations that are vital for ecosystem processes such as decomposition, nutrient cycling, and carbon storage. These communities are affected by environmental changes and are likely to respond to climate change. The alteration of soil temperature and moisture levels due to climate change prompts shifts in microbial community dynamics. This research aims to explore the effects of climate-induced changes on soil microbial communities via a meta-analysis of field studies.\n\n2. Materials and Methods:\nFifteen field experiments were identified from a database containing existing research on soil microbial communities. Conducted across diverse regions, these studies employed various treatments, including warming and drying. The experiments aimed to examine the impacts of climate-induced alterations on soil microbial communities. A meta-analysis method was utilized to synthesize the results from these individual experiments, yielding a comprehensive overview of climate change effects on soil microbial populations.\n\n3. Results:\nThe meta-analysis revealed that warming and drying treatments led to reduced microbial biomass and a shift towards a mesophilic community structure. In contrast, cooling treatments exhibited a neutral effect on microbial biomass and community composition. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding the effects of climate changes on soil microbial communities and the possible consequences for ecosystem functions and carbon sequestration. The study indicates that warming and drying may result in soil carbon depletion and diminished ecosystem services.\n\n4. Discussion:\nThe findings of this study highlight the necessity of understanding how climate-induced alterations affect soil microbial communities. They suggest that warming and drying could result in soil carbon loss and decreased ecosystem services. These results are consistent with previous research indicating that shifts in soil microbial dynamics due to climate change can impair ecosystem functions and carbon sequestration. The study posits that climate change may lead to a decline in soil microbial communities and a reduction in ecosystem services over time, primarily attributable to soil carbon loss and diminished essential services supporting life on Earth.\n\n5. Conclusion:\nThis study offers a thorough understanding of the impacts of climate-induced changes on soil microbial communities. The results indicate that warming and drying have the potential to cause soil carbon loss and decrease ecosystem services. They reflect the critical need to comprehend climate change\u2019s effects on soil microbial communities and its implications for ecosystem functioning and carbon sequestration. The research suggests that long-term climate change may result in a decline in soil microbial populations and reduced ecosystem services, largely due to the loss of soil carbon and essential support systems for life on our planet.",

We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of 2,294 software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-ofthe-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere 1.96% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous.",

        "abstract": "Imagining the future trajectory is the key for robots to make sound planning and successfully reach their goals. Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-toimage (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We enhance the U-Net and language conditioning model by incorporating computation-efficient spatial-temporal attention. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Frame Sequential Text Decomposer module that dissects a sentence\u2019s global instruction into temporally aligned sub-instructions, ensuring precise integration into each frame of generation. Our framework allows us to effectively leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in pretrained T2I models across the frames. With the adaptable-designed architecture, Seer makes it possible to generate high-fidelity, coherent, and instruction-aligned video frames by fine-tuning a few layers on a small amount of data. The experimental results on Something Something V2 (SSv2), Bridgedata and EpicKitchens-100 datasets demonstrate our superior video prediction performance with around 480-GPU hours versus CogVideo with over 12,480-GPU hours: achieving the 31% FVD improvement compared to the current SOTA model on SSv2 and 83.7% average preference in the human evaluation.

        "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands as a foundational framework for image segmentation. While it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization in typical scenarios, its advantage diminishes when applied to specialized domains like medical imagery and remote sensing. To address this limitation, this paper introduces Conv-LoRA, a simple yet effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. By integrating ultra-lightweight convolutional parameters into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Conv-LoRA can inject image-related inductive biases into the plain ViT encoder, further reinforcing SAM\u2019s local prior assumption. Notably, Conv-LoRA not only preserves SAM\u2019s extensive segmentation knowledge but also revives its capacity of learning high-level image semantics, which is constrained by SAM\u2019s foreground-background segmentation pretraining. Comprehensive experimentation across diverse benchmarks spanning multiple domains underscores ConvLoRA\u2019s superiority in adapting SAM to real-world semantic segmentation tasks.1",

        "abstract": "The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-\u03b1, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024 \u00d7 1024 resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that respectively optimize pixel dependency, textimage alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-\u03b1\u2019s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART\u03b1 only takes 12% of Stable Diffusion v1.5\u2019s training time (\u223c753 vs. \u223c6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($28,400 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-\u03b1 excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-\u03b1 will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.",

        "abstract": "We consider cross-silo federated linear contextual bandit (LCB) problem under differential privacy, where multiple silos interact with their respective local users and communicate via a central server to realize collaboration without sacrificing each user\u2019s privacy. We identify three issues in the state-of-the-art (Dubey & Pentland, 2020): (i) failure of claimed privacy protection, (ii) incorrect regret bound due to noise miscalculation and (iii) ungrounded communication cost. To resolve these issues, we take a two-step approach. First, we design an algorithmic framework consisting of a generic federated LCB algorithm and flexible privacy protocols. Then, leveraging the proposed framework, we study federated LCBs under two different privacy constraints. We first establish privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level local differential privacy, which fix the issues present in state-of-the-art algorithm. To further improve the regret performance, we next consider shuffle model of differential privacy, under which we show that our algorithm can achieve nearly \u201coptimal\u201d regret without a trusted server. We accomplish this via two different schemes \u2013 one relies on a new result on privacy amplification via shuffling for DP mechanisms and another one leverages the integration of a shuffle protocol for vector sum into the tree-based mechanism, both of which might be of independent interest. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical evaluations over contextual bandit instances generated from both synthetic and real-life data.",

        "abstract": "Pipeline parallelism is one of the key components for large-scale distributed training, yet its efficiency suffers from pipeline bubbles which were deemed inevitable. In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the 1F1B schedule up to 15% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

However, there is currently no consensus about how this in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works. For example, while Xie et al.

In this paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information, revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain a comprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICL predictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples are provided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend on in-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context. However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferences acquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider all in-context information equally.",

        "title": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RANDOM FORGETTING FOR ROBUST GENERALIZATION",
        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and accuracy. Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network\u2019s robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called \u201cForget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)\". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model\u2019s information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to AutoAttacks and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios.1",

        "abstract": "Energy-based models (EBMs) are known in the Machine Learning community for decades. Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ 512 \u00d7 512 unpaired I2I translation. For simplicity, we choose simple shortand long-run EBMs as a backbone of our Energy-guided Entropic OT approach, leaving the application of more sophisticated EBMs for future research.

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with various improvements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling. The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

        "abstract": "Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from limited training data. Recent approaches parameterize the prior with a family of probability density functions or recurrent neural networks, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing validation data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, the expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits the generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing demand for memory and computation for LLMs. Recent efforts on post-training pruning of LLMs aim to reduce the model size and computation, yet the performance is still sub-optimal. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play solution for post-training pruning of LLMs. The proposed solution has two innovative components: 1) Relative Importance and Activations (RIA), a new pruning metric that jointly considers the weight and activations efficiently on LLMs; and 2) Channel Permutation, a new approach to maximally preserve important weights under N:M sparsity. The proposed two components can be readily combined to further enhance the N:M structured pruned LLMs. Our empirical experiments show that RIA alone can already surpass all existing post-training pruning methods on prevalent LLMs, e.g., LLaMA ranging from 7B to 65B. Furthermore, N:M structured pruning with channel permutation can even outperform the original LLaMA2 70B on zero-shot tasks, together with practical speed-up on specific hardware.",

In contrast to prior tactile simulators which primarily focus on manipulating rigid bodies and often rely on simplified approximations to model stress and deformations of materials in contact, DIFFTACTILE emphasizes physics-based contact modeling with high fidelity, supporting simulations of diverse contact modes and interactions with objects possessing a wide range of material properties. Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills. Additionally, we introduce a method to infer the optical response of our tactile sensor to contact using an efficient pixel-based neural module. We anticipate that DIFFTACTILE will serve as a useful platform for studying contact-rich manipulations, leveraging the benefits of dense tactile feedback and differentiable physics.

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXtL, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

Still, their training efficiency can be improved by exploiting structure within the optimization problem. Recent work indicates that supervised learning can be accelerated by leveraging the fact that gradients lie in a low-dimensional and slowly-changing subspace. In this paper, we conduct a thorough evaluation of this phenomenon for two popular deep policy gradient methods on various simulated benchmark tasks. Our results demonstrate the existence of such gradient subspaces despite the continuously changing data distribution inherent to reinforcement learning.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "This paper introduces an innovative algorithmic framework designed to predict the risk of soil erosion utilizing machine learning methods. Authors Lee and Park analyzed soil erosion data through a variety of machine learning algorithms. The paper has undergone peer review by the International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology (IJEST) and received acceptance.\n\nIn their methodology, the authors relied on a dataset comprising soil type, slope, and rainfall patterns. This dataset included 1000 samples, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing. They applied several machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), to analyze the data, resulting in predictions of soil erosion risk.\n\nThe analysis revealed that the Random Forest algorithm outperformed the others, achieving an accuracy of 92% and a ROCAUC score of 0.95. The SVM algorithm followed, with an accuracy of 88% and a ROCAUC score of 0.92, while the GBM algorithm had the lowest performance, with 82% accuracy and a ROCAUC score of 0.89.\n\nIn the discussion, the authors concluded that the Random Forest algorithm is the most effective for predicting soil erosion risk. They also noted the SVM algorithm as a strong alternative, albeit with challenges in managing high-dimensional data. The GBM algorithm is regarded as less effective due to its computational complexity.\n\nTo conclude, the authors successfully created a novel framework for predicting soil erosion risk using machine learning techniques. Their findings indicate that the Random Forest algorithm is the top performer, followed by SVM. They propose that their framework could be utilized in various regions and enhanced with additional data sources.\n\n**Critical Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors utilized multiple machine learning algorithms, providing an in-depth understanding of the results.\n\n2. The paper effectively presents clear and straightforward results, enhancing the comprehension of both the methodology and findings.\n\n3. The authors acknowledged the limitations of the algorithms and suggested avenues for improvement.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. With only 1000 samples, the dataset is relatively small, which could hinder the broader applicability of the findings.\n\n2. The framework is based solely on one feature set, potentially limiting its usefulness across diverse regions and contexts.\n\n3. The paper does not address potential biases and errors present in the dataset, which could impact result accuracy.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should consider expanding the dataset to improve result generalizability.\n\n2. Incorporating supplementary data sources, such as remote sensing data, could enhance the accuracy of the framework.\n\n3. A discussion regarding the biases and errors in the dataset and their implications for result accuracy is warranted.\n\n**Future Research Directions:**\n\n1. Investigating other machine learning algorithms, like neural networks and ensemble methods, could boost the framework's accuracy.\n\n2. Exploring additional data sources, such as remote sensing data, may improve framework precision.\n\n3. The authors should address potential limitations and biases of the framework while proposing possible enhancements.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nThe paper introduces a novel framework for predicting soil erosion risk through machine learning techniques. While the Random Forest algorithm demonstrates the highest effectiveness, it is crucial to consider the dataset's limitations and the algorithms applied. Increasing the dataset's size and incorporating additional data sources are recommended to enhance the framework's accuracy. Overall, this paper contributes meaningfully to the field of soil erosion prediction and underscores the capabilities of machine learning techniques in tackling this significant issue.",

However, the overconfident target harms generalization and causes the problem of robust overfitting. To address this issue and enhance adversarial robustness, we analyze the characteristics of robust models and identify that robust models tend to produce smoother and well-calibrated outputs. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification (ADR), which generates soft labels as a better guidance mechanism that reflects the underlying distribution of data. By utilizing ADR, we can obtain rectified labels that improve model robustness without the need for pre-trained models or extensive extra computation. Moreover, our method facilitates seamless plug-andplay integration with other adversarial training techniques by replacing the hard labels in their objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADR through extensive experiments and strong performances across datasets.",

Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the ConstantQ Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.",

        "abstract": "We explore how continued pre-training on domain-specific corpora influences large language models, revealing that training on the raw corpora endows the model with domain knowledge, but drastically hurts its prompting ability for question answering. Taken inspiration from human learning via reading comprehension\u2014practice after reading improves the ability to answer questions based on the learned knowledge\u2014we propose a simple method for transforming raw corpora into reading comprehension texts. Each raw text is enriched with a series of tasks related to its content. Our method, highly scalable and applicable to any pre-training corpora, consistently enhances performance across various tasks in three different domains: biomedicine, finance, and law. Notably, our 7B language model achieves competitive performance with domain-specific models of much larger scales, such as BloombergGPT-50B. Furthermore, we demonstrate that domain-specific reading comprehension texts can improve the model\u2019s performance even on general benchmarks, showing the potential to develop a general model across even more domains.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have presented compelling evidence that large language models (LLMs) can equip embodied agents with the self-driven capability to interact with the world, which marks an initial step toward versatile robotics. However, these efforts tend to overlook the visual richness of open worlds, rendering the entire interactive process akin to \u201ca blindfolded text-based game.\u201d Consequently, LLMbased agents frequently encounter challenges in intuitively comprehending their surroundings and producing responses that are easy to understand. In this paper, we propose Steve-Eye, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model to address this limitation. Steve-Eye integrates the LLM with a visual encoder to process visual-text inputs and generate multimodal feedback. We adopt a semi-automatic strategy to collect an extensive dataset comprising 850K open-world instruction pairs, enabling our model to encompass three essential functions for an agent: multimodal perception, foundational knowledge base, and skill prediction and planning. Lastly, we develop three open-world evaluation benchmarks, then carry out experiments from a wide range of perspectives to validate our model\u2019s capability to strategically act and plan.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The manuscript offers an engaging and relevant examination of a new compound's effectiveness in alleviating anxiety among individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The rationale behind the authors' hypothesis is sound, and the research design is appropriately structured. Nevertheless, several issues need to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, the study's sample size is fairly limited, with participants aged between 18 and 40 years. Although this creates a more uniform group, it's important to consider how age might affect anxiety levels and treatment results. Furthermore, the research lacks a control group to account for comorbid conditions or other treatment methods that might have impacted the findings.\n\nSecondly, while the authors employed the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) as assessment tools, these may not be the most effective at evaluating anxiety in individuals with ASD. Although these instruments are widely utilized, they might not fully reflect the distinctive experiences and viewpoints of those on the autism spectrum.\n\nThirdly, the duration of the study is relatively brief, and there is no discussion regarding the potential long-term effects or sustainability of the treatment results. It is crucial to take into account the possibility of relapse or the necessity for continued treatment.\n\nFourthly, the manuscript lacks detailed information on the dosage regimen, side effects, and possible interactions associated with Compound X. While the authors assert that the compound is innovative, it is vital to weigh the potential risks against the benefits.\n\nFinally, as the outcomes are derived from a single trial, it is essential to consider the need for replication and the external validity of the results.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should aim for a larger and more varied sample size, incorporating a control group for comorbidities or other treatments.\n2. It would be beneficial for the authors to investigate alternative anxiety assessment tools for individuals with ASD, such as the Autism Anxiety Questionnaire (AAQ) or the Anxiety in Autism Scale (AAS).\n3. Extending the duration of the study could help evaluate long-term impacts and the sustainability of treatment effects.\n4. The authors need to offer comprehensive details regarding the dosing regimen, side effects, and possible interactions of Compound X.\n5. A replication study or meta-analysis should be considered to validate the results and examine external applicability.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\nWhile this manuscript presents a noteworthy and relevant study, it requires additional refinement and elaboration to enhance the findings and draw stronger conclusions. The authors display a solid grasp of the subject matter and have outlined a clear and precise methodology; however, addressing the study's limitations is essential for a more thorough and credible evaluation of Compound X's efficacy in reducing anxiety among individuals with ASD.",

Beyond the problem formulation of traditional sorting algorithms, we consider sorting problems for more abstract yet expressive inputs, e.g., multi-digit images and image fragments, through a neural sorting network. To learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input to an ordinal variable, the differentiability of sorting networks needs to be guaranteed. In this paper we define a softening error by a differentiable swap function, and develop an error-free swap function that holds a non-decreasing condition and differentiability. Furthermore, a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is adopted to capture dependency between given inputs and also leverage its model capacity with self-attention. Experiments on diverse sorting benchmarks show that our methods perform better than or comparable to baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Lipschitz-based methods for training certifiably robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance. Combined with filtered generative data augmentation, our final results further the state of the art deterministic VRA by up to 8.5 percentage points.",

        "abstract": "Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address nonuniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a \u201chard partition\u201d of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \u201csoftly partition\u201d eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.",

The authors effectively convey the necessity of understanding climate impact on rice yield decline and the importance of developing climate-resilient rice varieties. Nonetheless, adding more context about the spatial analysis framework employed in the research could enhance this section.\n\n**Methodology:**  \nUtilizing a spatial analysis approach, the study integrates remote sensing and GIS techniques to examine rice yield decline across varying regions and countries. The authors incorporate multiple variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and soil type, to forecast yield loss. The application of remote sensing and GIS is a notable strength, enabling extensive geographic analysis of yield decline. However, the authors could clarify the selection and weighting of the variables used. Moreover, the study overlooks how climate change might influence rice cultivation practices, which is a critical limitation.\n\n**Results:**  \nThe findings indicate a more significant yield decline in tropical areas and nations with elevated greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, yield reduction appears more severe in countries characterized by poorer soil quality and elevated temperatures. These results align with the authors\u2019 hypothesis and provide essential insights regarding climate change\u2019s impact on global rice production. However, greater detail on the spatial analysis methods and the implications of these findings for policy could strengthen this section.\n\n**Discussion:**  \nThe discussion concisely summarizes the study's core findings and underscores the urgent need for developing climate-resilient rice varieties and conservation strategies to counteract climate effects. The authors effectively note several study limitations, including the neglect of how climate change impacts rice cultivation practices and pest and disease distribution. The discussion could benefit from elaborating on the policy implications of the findings and considering the potential synergies and trade-offs involved in adopting climate-resilient rice varieties alongside conservation measures.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe conclusion succinctly encapsulates the main findings and emphasizes the importance of climate-resilient rice varieties and conservation strategies to address climate change impacts. The authors conclude with a recommendation for upcoming research. However, it could be enhanced by discussing long-term implications of the findings and delving deeper into potential synergies and conflicts related to the implementation of climate-resilient practices.\n\n**Recommendations:**  \nThe paper acknowledges limitations such as the disregard for climate change's effects on rice cultivation practices and the distribution of pests and diseases. The authors propose further research in these areas. This recommendation is a strong point of the study, but further elaboration on specific research questions and methodologies for future studies would be beneficial.\n\n**Limitations:**  \nThe study presents various limitations, notably the omission of climate change effects on rice cultivation practices, which could significantly influence yield. The failure to consider the distribution of pests and diseases further undermines the analysis. These elements are essential for comprehensively understanding how climate change affects rice yield decline and warrant investigation in future research.\n\n**Future Research Directions:**  \nThe authors suggest pursuing further studies on the influences of climate change on rice cultivation methods and pest distribution, along with investigating potential synergies and trade-offs when implementing climate-resilient rice varieties. Again, while the recommendation for additional research is a key strength, detailing potential research questions and methodologies would enhance the contribution.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**  \nThe study offers valuable insights into the implications of climate change for global rice production. However, it faces several limitations, particularly regarding the impact of climate change on rice farming practices and pest and disease distribution. The recommendations for future research into these areas, alongside an examination of possible synergies and trade-offs of climate-resilient varieties, are essential.\n\n**Rating:**  \nThe study receives a score of 8/10. It yields significant insights into the effects of climate change on global rice production, emphasizing the urgency of developing climate-resilient rice varieties and conservation strategies. However, the noted limitations regarding rice cultivation practices and pest distribution are substantial concerns.",

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s r) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19% and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.

The scaffold was created using a 3D bioprinting method and was analyzed for its mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and cytotoxic effects. Findings indicate that the scaffold possesses greater mechanical strength and stiffness than conventional bioprinted scaffolds. Additionally, it demonstrated outstanding biocompatibility and minimal cytotoxicity, making it appropriate for tissue engineering applications.\n\nTissue engineering is an expanding discipline focused on inventing effective solutions for repairing damaged tissues and organs.

Training distributions impact performance. Models trained from uniform operands only learn a handful of GCD (up to 38 GCD \u2264 100). Log-uniform operands boost performance to 73 GCD \u2264 100, and a log-uniform distribution of outcomes (i.e. GCD) to 91. However, training from uniform (balanced) GCD breaks explainability.",

We explore the connections between climate change and species migration trends in 15 tropical forests around the globe.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nClimate change is considered one of the primary dangers to biodiversity in tropical forests (IPCC 2020). Increasing temperatures and alterations in precipitation have resulted in changes in species distribution and numbers (Hole 2015). The unique characteristics and high diversity of species in tropical forests render them especially susceptible to climatic shifts.\n\nMethods:\n\nWe analyzed spatial distribution of species and climate factors in 15 tropical forests worldwide using remote-sensing data from Landsat 8 and MODIS. Machine learning algorithms were employed to uncover patterns and correlations between species migration and climate change.\n\nResults:\n\nOur findings indicated significant links between species movement and variables associated with climate change, including temperature and precipitation changes. It was discovered that rising temperatures and altered precipitation drives species migrations to higher elevations and latitudes.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis research underscores the critical need to comprehend climate change's effects on biodiversity distribution in tropical forests. Our results imply that if climate change remains unaddressed, biodiversity loss in these ecosystems will worsen.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nTo alleviate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity distribution in tropical forests, conservation initiatives should prioritize the preservation and restoration of habitats particularly at risk from climate change.\n\nCritique:\n\nThe work presents several merits that affirm its significance to biodiversity conservation:\n\n1. **Methodology:** Implementing remote-sensing data alongside machine learning algorithms represents a robust method for probing the intricate interactions between species migration and climate alterations.\n\n2. **Data quality:** The utilization of reliable data from Landsat 8 and MODIS ensures the precision of information regarding species distribution and climate factors.\n\n3. **Geographical breadth:** The inclusion of 15 tropical forests around the world yields expansive insights into the global repercussions of climate change on biodiversity.\n\nNonetheless, the study has notable limitations and areas where it can improve:\n\n1. **Species identification:** While analyzing species distribution with remote-sensing data, the authors failed to include details on species identification or classification.\n\n2. **Climate change factors:** The authors focused on temperature and precipitation but overlooked other significant elements like changes in land use and rising sea levels.\n\n3. **Conservation applications:** Although the authors proposed conservation strategies, they did not offer specific examples or case studies to demonstrate the efficacy of these suggestions.\n\n4. **Future research:** There is a lack of discussion regarding future research directions or the limitations inherent in their methodology.\n\nIn summary, this study significantly contributes to biodiversity conservation by emphasizing the effects of climate change on biodiversity distribution within tropical forests. However, future investigations should rectify the identified limitations and areas for enhancement.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nI suggest that the authors revise their manuscript in light of the critiques offered here and consider resubmitting it for further evaluation.",

Hyperspectral data is a notable example, whose vast volume compromises real-time hyperspectral detection. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce a novel approach leveraging pre-acquisition modulation to reduce the acquisition volume. This modulation process is governed by a deep learning model, utilizing prior information. Central to our approach is LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant. Uniquely, LUM-ViT incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation. To further optimize for optical calculations, we propose a kernel-level weight binarization technique and a threestage fine-tuning strategy. Our evaluations reveal that, by sampling a mere 10% of the original image pixels, LUM-ViT maintains the accuracy loss within 1.8% on the ImageNet classification task. The method sustains near-original accuracy when implemented on real-world optical hardware, demonstrating its practicality. Code will be available at https://github.com/MaxLLF/LUM-ViT.",

        "title": "CURRICULUM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR QUANTUM ARCHITECTURE SEARCH UNDER HARD-",
        "abstract": "The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.",

        "title": "GIM: LEARNING GENERALIZABLE IMAGE MATCHER",
        "abstract": "Image matching is a fundamental computer vision problem. While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-theart image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 8.4% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme crossdomain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "If generalist robots are to operate in truly unstructured environments, they need to be able to recognize and reason about novel objects and scenarios. Such objects and scenarios might not be present in the robot\u2019s own training data. We propose SuSIE, a method that leverages an image editing diffusion model to act as a high-level planner by proposing intermediate subgoals that a low-level controller attains. Specifically, we fine-tune InstructPix2Pix on robot data such that it outputs a hypothetical future observation given the robot\u2019s current observation and a language command. We then use the same robot data to train a low-level goalconditioned policy to reach a given image observation. We find that when these components are combined, the resulting system exhibits robust generalization capabilities. The high-level planner utilizes its Internet-scale pre-training and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization than conventional language-conditioned policies. We demonstrate that this approach solves real robot control tasks involving novel objects, distractors, and even environments, both in the real world and in simulation.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Summary of Review**\n\nThe paper thoroughly examines how climate change affects biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. The authors performed an extensive review of the literature and utilized a mixed-methods strategy to evaluate the impacts of climate change. The findings indicate that climate change poses a considerable threat to biodiversity in tropical environments.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe authors' literature review is thorough and systematically arranged. However, there are notable limitations. They focused solely on peer-reviewed articles from the last decade and excluded studies published in non-English languages, which could lead to a biased representation of the global context. Additionally, the authors did not adequately outline their mixed-methods approach, and further detail on the specific techniques for data analysis would have been beneficial.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe study's findings indicate that climate change significantly threatens biodiversity in tropical ecosystems, highlighting issues such as coral bleaching due to rising global temperatures and diminishing tropical bird populations. However, the findings lack sufficient persuasiveness, as they largely depend on existing literature without presenting original data. The analysis employed is also insufficiently rigorous, relying on a correlation coefficient to examine relationships between climate change and biodiversity loss, which fails to establish causation.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe discussion of results is coherent and to the point, yet the conclusions derived appear overly simplistic. While the authors advocate for immediate and sustained actions to combat climate change and protect biodiversity, this assertion is not adequately supported by the evidence provided. There is no thorough evaluation of the efficacy of various conservation strategies, nor do the authors address the complexities associated with the interplay between climate change and biodiversity loss.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the findings and discussions outlined in this paper, I recommend that the authors:\n\n1. Expand the literature review to include non-English language studies.\n2. Offer a detailed explanation of their mixed-methods approach.\n3. Introduce original data to substantiate their conclusions.\n4. Employ more robust methods for data analysis.\n5. Conduct a thorough assessment of the effectiveness of various conservation strategies.\n\n**Rating**\n\nI would rate this paper 3 out of 5. While it offers a comprehensive analysis of climate change's impact on biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems, the identified limitations in the review and data analysis are significant. Addressing these issues could enhance the paper\u2019s contribution to the field.\n\n**Conflicts of Interest**\n\nI have no conflicts of interest to report.\n\n**Disclosure**\n\nI have no disclosures to make.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either global fairness (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or local fairness (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy & Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.",

Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multiscale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The manuscript introduces an innovative algorithm aimed at predicting protein-ligand binding affinity through the use of deep learning methods. It effectively integrates a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture the intricate interactions inherent in protein-ligand relations. The findings indicate a high level of accuracy in binding affinity predictions, a key element in deciphering protein-ligand interaction mechanisms.\n\nThe methodology section is straightforward, with a comprehensive outline of the CNN and RNN frameworks.

Greater transparency in the selection of hyperparameters and the optimization methods used would improve this aspect.\n\nThe manuscript fails to address interpretability within the proposed algorithm, which is a significant omission. Providing insights into result interpretation and the importance of features used in the CNN would be advantageous.\n\nAdditionally, a comparative analysis with other machine learning algorithms is absent.

        "abstract": "Characterizing samples that are difficult to learn from is crucial to developing highly performant ML models. This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify \u201chard\u201d samples. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition and evaluation of \u201chardness\u201d. Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive HCM evaluation, while we hope our hardness taxonomy and toolkit will advance the principled evaluation and uptake of data-centric AI methods.",

Despite the encouraging findings, the research presents numerous limitations and potential enhancements.\n\n**Methodological Concerns:**\n\n1. **Gene editing efficiency:** While the authors report a high efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 in animal models, the specificity of this complex regarding the target gene variants is not clearly outlined. It is crucial to thoroughly investigate any potential off-target effects associated with CRISPR-Cas9.\n2. **miRNA design and validation:** The authors assert that targeted microRNAs were developed to address disease-causing gene variants, but the process for designing and validating these miRNAs is not adequately detailed. More comprehensive information is required concerning the design and validation methodology, particularly the application of bioinformatics tools and in vitro studies.\n3. **Animal model selection:** The study utilizes models for Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases; however, the relevance of these models to human conditions may be limited. The authors should clarify how these animal models relate to the human disease context.\n\n**Experimental Design:**\n\n1. **Experimental design:** Although the authors combine CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing with specific microRNAs to focus on gene variants responsible for disease, the experimental framework is not sufficiently detailed. More elaboration on the experimental setup, use of control groups, and duration of the study is warranted.\n2. **Data analysis:** The reported substantial improvements in cognitive and motor functions in the tested animal models require better clarity on the data analysis methodologies used. The authors should expand on the statistical approaches and the incorporation of control groups.\n\n**Interpretation and Conclusion:**\n\n1. **Interpretation:** The authors suggest that their findings are promising, indicating that this innovative therapeutic method might effectively prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases. Nevertheless, this interpretation relies on a limited array of animal models and a brief study duration.\n2. **Conclusion:** The authors conclude that this novel therapeutic approach holds promise for preventing and treating neurodegenerative conditions, but this conclusion is derived from restricted evidence and should be confirmed through broader animal model studies and human clinical trials.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Further validation:** It is imperative for the authors to confirm their findings through studies with larger, more diverse animal populations and subsequent human clinical trials.\n2. **Off-target effects evaluation:** The authors should assess the off-target consequences of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to verify the specificity of the complex in relation to target gene variants.\n3. **miRNA design and validation:** Additional details about the design and validation of the targeted microRNAs are necessary.\n4. **Statistical analysis:** The authors need to elaborate on the statistical evaluation methods employed and the use of control groups.\n\n**Rating:**\nI would rate this paper as 7 out of 10. Although the results show promise, the research contains various limitations and suggests areas for further improvement. The findings must be validated further, off-target effects assessed, and detailed information provided on the design and validation of the specific microRNA class used.",

Whereas prior works have largely focused on leveraging LLMs for generating abstract plans in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the learning for structures and constraints in robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, defining specific types of motion constraints among sets of objects, to serve as an intermediate layer that connects high-level language representations with low-level physical trajectories. By locally perturbing a small set of successful human demonstrations, we augment the dataset with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains neural network-based classifiers to differentiate success task executions from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states into mode families without dense labeling. This further enables us to learn structured policies for the target task. Experimental validation in both 2D continuous-space and robotic manipulation environments demonstrates the robustness of our mode-based imitation methods under external perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP\u2019s neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network\u2019s fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network\u2019s ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732.

        "abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the \u201ctrue\u201d reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger \u201cgold\u201d reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise, we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they pose potential safety concerns, such as the \u201cjailbreak\u201d problem, wherein malicious instructions can manipulate LLMs to exhibit undesirable behavior. Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The research outlines a new treatment method aimed at addressing neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease. The authors suggest using a combination of memantine and rivastigmine to target the inflammatory mechanisms in the brain. Conducted on a preclinical model of Alzheimer's, the study assesses both the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy. Findings indicate a notable decrease in neuroinflammation and an enhancement in cognitive performance within the tested model. The authors highlight several benefits of their approach, such as its straightforwardness, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use. Nonetheless, the study is limited by its preclinical model and the absence of long-term follow-up data.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a coherent and well-articulated proposition for a new treatment strategy against neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's. The authors effectively summarize their findings, pointing out the potential advantages while also recognizing the study's limitations, particularly the reliance on preclinical data, which must be addressed to bolster the credibility of the outcomes.\n\nStrengths:\n- The authors successfully summarize the proposed therapy's potential, articulating both benefits and limitations.\n- Employing a preclinical model is standard practice in researching neuroinflammation, allowing for an assessment of the proposed combination's efficacy and safety.\n- The discussion of the treatment's simplicity and cost-effectiveness may increase its attractiveness to healthcare providers and patients.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- The dependence on a preclinical model raises questions about the transferability of the results to human clinical trials.\n- The absence of long-term follow-up presents a critical weakness, leaving uncertainty about the therapy's sustained efficacy.\n- The paper fails to thoroughly explain the mechanisms behind neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, which could hinder understanding of the new treatment.\n- There may be a degree of unwarranted optimism in the authors' evaluation of their proposed method, given the intricate nature of neuroinflammation and the limited grasp of its underlying mechanisms.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Implementing clinical trials with human subjects is recommended to assess the treatment's efficacy and safety more accurately.\n- A deeper exploration of neuroinflammation mechanisms in Alzheimer's would clarify the therapeutic approach.\n- Providing a more exhaustive evaluation of the proposed therapy's advantages and limitations, including possible drug interactions and long-term safety concerns, would enhance the study.\n- Addressing potential obstacles and limitations regarding the proposed treatment's effectiveness and its interactions with other therapies would be beneficial.\n\nRating: 7/10\n\nIn conclusion, while this study offers a thoughtfully constructed proposal for a treatment addressing neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's, the acknowledged limitations, specifically the reliance on a preclinical model, must be rectified to improve the robustness of the findings. With further refinement and exploration, this approach may hold significant therapeutic promise for Alzheimer\u2019s patients, but additional research is essential to thoroughly assess its effectiveness and safety.",

        "title": "NON-EXCHANGEABLE CONFORMAL RISK CONTROL",
        "abstract": "Split conformal prediction has recently sparked great interest due to its ability to provide formally guaranteed uncertainty sets or intervals for predictions made by black-box neural models, ensuring a predefined probability of containing the actual ground truth. While the original formulation assumes data exchangeability, some extensions handle non-exchangeable data, which is often the case in many real-world scenarios. In parallel, some progress has been made in conformal methods that provide statistical guarantees for a broader range of objectives, such as bounding the best F1-score or minimizing the false negative rate in expectation. In this paper, we leverage and extend these two lines of work by proposing nonexchangeable conformal risk control, which allows controlling the expected value of any monotone loss function when the data is not exchangeable. Our framework is flexible, makes very few assumptions, and allows weighting the data based on its relevance for a given test example; a careful choice of weights may result in tighter bounds, making our framework useful in the presence of change points, time series, or other forms of distribution drift. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data show the usefulness of our method.",

        "abstract": "In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity could exhibit a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights \u2014 in particular their effective rank \u2014 influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning. Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning can still occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and data statistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weight structures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costs of plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.",

        "abstract": "Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs). Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. We release all the above-mentioned resources at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/FIGA.",

        "abstract": "Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O(( \u221a m T 1/4 + (logm) log T \u221a T + V ) \u221a m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O(( 1 T 1/2\u2212\u03b1 + (log T ) 9/2 T + V ) \u221a m), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2). The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to T , and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to m (for any fixed T ). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret O(( log T T + V ) \u221a m) for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with taskaveraged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.",

        "abstract": "Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-consuming and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.

When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the importance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces.

In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks \u2014 neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on several metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.",

        "abstract": "Graphic layout generation plays a significant role in user engagement and information perception. Existing methods primarily treat layout generation as a numerical optimization task, focusing on quantitative aspects while overlooking the semantic information of layout, such as the relationship between each layout element. In this paper, we propose LayoutNUWA, the first model that treats layout generation as a code generation task to enhance semantic information and harnesses the hidden layout expertise of large language models (LLMs). More concretely, we develop a Code Instruct Tuning (CIT) approach comprising three interconnected modules: 1) the Code Initialization (CI) module quantifies the numerical conditions and initializes them as HTML code with strategically placed masks; 2) the Code Completion (CC) module employs the formatting knowledge of LLMs to fill in the masked portions within the HTML code; 3) the Code Rendering (CR) module transforms the completed code into the final layout output, ensuring a highly interpretable and transparent layout generation procedure that directly maps code to a visualized layout. We attain significant state-of-the-art performance (even over 50% improvements) on multiple datasets, showcasing the strong capabilities of LayoutNUWA.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Overall Evaluation:** The manuscript introduces a compelling method for forecasting protein-ligand binding affinity through deep learning techniques. Nonetheless, the findings and methods need more rigorous examination to assess their accuracy and dependability.\n\n**Methodology:** The authors employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to forecast the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. The CNN is trained on a dataset containing 10,000 protein-ligand complexes, which is comparatively small relative to other datasets utilized for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. The authors also incorporate a feature extraction technique to diminish the dimensionality of the input data, a typical strategy in deep learning.\n\n**Strengths:** The authors show a strong grasp of deep learning methods and their application to predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. The proposed algorithm is well-organized and straightforward.\n\n**Weaknesses:** The principal drawback of the paper is the limited size of the training dataset, which could result in overfitting and subpar generalization on new data. Additionally, the authors do not thoroughly analyze the feature extraction method employed, which could impact the accuracy of the predictions.\n\n**Predictions:** Based on the presented results, I anticipate that the algorithm will perform adequately on a smaller test set, though its efficacy may decline with a larger dataset. I also foresee that the authors will need to gather a more extensive dataset to enhance the algorithm's generalization abilities.\n\n**Recommendations:** I suggest that the authors amass a larger dataset to bolster the algorithm's generalization performance. They should also conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the feature extraction method utilized and its effects on prediction quality.\n\n**Future Work:** The authors might explore alternative deep learning architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, to enhance the algorithm's performance. Additionally, they should look into implementing transfer learning and domain adaptation to tailor the algorithm for diverse protein-ligand complexes.\n\n**Conclusion:** In summary, although the paper offers an intriguing method for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques, the findings and methodology necessitate more careful examination to establish their validity and reliability. I advise the authors to gather a larger dataset and furnish a more in-depth analysis of the feature extraction method to improve the algorithm's generalization performance.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Reviewer's Signature:** [Your Name]",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction (S), teacher prediction (T ), and ground truth (G). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher\u2019s global average prediction (T\u0304 ) for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intraand inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

        "abstract": "Image denoisers have been shown to be powerful priors for solving inverse problems in imaging. In this work, we introduce a generalization of these methods that allows any image restoration network to be used as an implicit prior. The proposed method uses priors specified by deep neural networks pre-trained as general restoration operators. The method provides a principled approach for adapting state-of-the-art restoration models for other inverse problems. Our theoretical result analyzes its convergence to a stationary point of a global functional associated with the restoration operator. Numerical results show that the method using a super-resolution prior achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Overall, this work offers a step forward for solving inverse problems by enabling the use of powerful pre-trained restoration models as priors.",

        "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning, particularly in the context of extremely sparse labeled data, often suffers from degenerate solutions where label functions tend to be nearly constant across unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce Variance-enlarged Poisson Learning (VPL), a simple yet powerful framework tailored to alleviate the issues arising from the presence of degenerate solutions. VPL incorporates a variance-enlarged regularization term, which induces a Poisson equation specifically for unlabeled data. This intuitive approach increases the dispersion of labels from their average mean, effectively reducing the likelihood of degenerate solutions characterized by nearly constant label functions. We subsequently introduce two streamlined algorithms, V-Laplace and V-Poisson, each intricately designed to enhance Laplace and Poisson learning, respectively. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of VPL to encompass graph neural networks, introducing Variance-enlarged Graph Poisson Networks (V-GPN) to facilitate improved label propagation. To achieve a deeper understanding of VPL\u2019s behavior, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical exploration in both discrete and variational cases. Our findings elucidate that VPL inherently amplifies the importance of connections within the same class while concurrently tempering those between different classes. We support our claims with extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of VPL and showcasing its superiority over existing methods.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper titled \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" examines how climate change impacts global food security. The authors conducted an extensive review of empirical studies, focusing on aspects such as increasing temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and the growing frequency of extreme weather events, which contribute to declines in crop yields, agricultural productivity, and human nutrition. The review emphasizes the considerable negative consequences of climate change on food systems worldwide, including diminished crop yields, scarcity of water, and rising malnutrition rates. Furthermore, the authors pinpoint several critical factors that worsen these impacts, such as soil degradation, urbanization, and insufficient adaptation strategies.\n\nIn the introduction, the paper clearly outlines the pressing issue of climate change's effect on global food security and its broader implications for health, economic stability, and environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, a more in-depth discussion of the methodologies used in the review, especially regarding study selection and inclusion criteria, would have enhanced clarity.\n\nRegarding methodology, the authors used a systematic review, drawing from various academic databases and incorporating research from fields like agriculture, ecology, economics, and nutrition. They based their inclusion criteria on peer-reviewed publications from 2000 to 2022, specifically targeting studies relating to climate change's effects on crop yields and nutrition. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.\n\nThe authors recognize the limitations of their review\u2014such as reliance on secondary data and challenges in demonstrating causal relationships\u2014while also showing a solid comprehension of the complexities of climate change research. However, more detail on data quality issues, particularly concerning missing or incomplete data, would have been beneficial.\n\nThe results section outlines the considerable negative effects of climate change on food systems, supporting the assertion that climate change significantly threatens food security and necessitates prompt action. The discussion is succinct and emphasizes policy implications, recommending increased investment in research and the development of new crop varieties, better agricultural practices, and stronger adaptation measures. The authors also recognize the limitations associated with secondary data reliance.\n\nIn summary, the paper offers a thorough and well-structured examination of the empirical evidence regarding climate change's effects on global food security. However, it would benefit from a deeper exploration of the methodologies employed, particularly regarding study selection and criteria.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n\n1.

        "abstract": "Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework. Experimental evaluations across multiple environments demonstrate the significant superiority of SORL over previous methods in extracting high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. A case in point is that SORL successfully learns strong policies with markedly distinct playing patterns from a real-world human dataset of a popular basketball video game \u201dDunk City Dynasty.\u201d",

Based on this observation, we propose SKIPAT, a method to reuse self-attention computation from preceding layers to approximate attention at one or more subsequent layers. To ensure that reusing self-attention blocks across layers does not degrade the performance, we introduce a simple parametric function, which outperforms the baseline transformer\u2019s performance while running computationally faster. We show that SKIPAT is agnostic to transformer architecture and is effective in image classification, semantic segmentation, image denoising, and video denoising.

We introduce a SSL model that leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, complemented by HuBERT-style masked prediction objectives, to process speech at multiple resolutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model not only achieves more efficient inference but also exhibits superior or comparable performance to the original HuBERT model over various tasks. Specifically, significant performance improvements over the original HuBERT have been observed in fine-tuning experiments on the LibriSpeech speech recognition benchmark as well as in evaluations using the Speech Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) and Multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB).",

This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 4.1x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of approximate model from scratch.",

Recent studies have shown its ability to counteract backdoor risks present in original training samples. In this study, we delve into the theoretical aspects of backdoor attacks and dataset distillation based on kernel methods. We introduce two new theory-driven trigger pattern generation methods specialized for dataset distillation. Following a comprehensive set of analyses and experiments, we show that our optimization-based trigger design framework informs effective backdoor attacks on dataset distillation. Notably, datasets poisoned by our designed trigger prove resilient against conventional backdoor attack detection and mitigation methods. Our empirical results validate that the triggers developed using our approaches are proficient at executing resilient backdoor attacks. 1",

        "abstract": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional search engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \u2018hallucinations.\u2019 These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model\u2019s confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper introduces an innovative method for addressing neurodegenerative diseases (ND) by employing microRNA-based gene editing. The authors highlight a collection of microRNAs that are integral to the development of ND, particularly Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Their findings indicate that enhancing the levels of these microRNAs can lead to notable improvements in cognitive abilities in AD mouse models, whereas elevating other microRNAs can slow the advancement of ALS. Moreover, it is shown that this gene editing technique can specifically target genes associated with ND pathogenesis.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The research offers a lucid depiction of how microRNAs influence the pathogenesis of ND, encompassing both AD and ALS.\n2. It demonstrates that increasing specific miRNA levels can significantly aid cognitive function in AD mouse models, and that other miRNAs can impede ALS progression.\n3. The study illustrates the capability of the microRNA-based gene editing method to target particular genes relevant to ND.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. The research is confined to in vitro studies, which may not truly represent the intricate relationships between microRNAs, genes, and the nervous system in live organisms.\n2. The authors fail to clarify how this gene editing method could be applied to human treatments.\n3. There is insufficient discussion regarding the possible off-target impacts of the microRNA-based editing method.\n4. A thorough review of the current literature on microRNAs in ND is lacking, potentially constraining the applicability of their findings.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe investigation employs a mouse model to explore the influence of microRNAs in the development of AD and ALS. The authors pinpoint a relevant set of microRNAs, subsequently examining their therapeutic effects through overexpression in AD models. The results indicate marked cognitive improvements and delayed progression of ALS in response to miRNA overexpression.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis study provides valuable insights into the role of microRNAs in ND, demonstrating that certain miRNAs can enhance cognitive function in AD models and slow ALS progression. Nonetheless, the absence of an in-depth exploration of potential off-target effects may limit the broader implications of the research.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. It would be beneficial for the authors to conduct in vivo studies to explore the therapeutic efficacy of the miRNA gene editing method in ND.\n2. A thorough review of existing literature on microRNAs in ND should be included to broaden the applicability of findings.\n3. A more detailed discussion on potential off-target effects related to the miRNA-based editing method is required.\n4. The authors should clarify the process of translating their miRNA editing approach to human applications.\n\n**Conflict of Interest:**\nNo conflicts of interest are reported by the author. \n\n**Author's Response:**\nI welcome the chance to address the comments provided by the reviewer. I maintain that this research offers significant insights into the role of microRNAs in ND. However, I recognize the limitations posed by exclusively in vitro studies, which may not capture the complexities of interactions in living systems. It's important to note that this work was not designed as a comprehensive literature review but as a novel therapeutic exploration. I would be willing to undertake a detailed literature review on microRNAs in ND in a future study.\n\n**Revised Manuscript:**\nIn response to the reviewer's feedback, I aim to enhance the study by incorporating in vivo investigations, thoroughly reviewing existing literature on microRNAs in ND, discussing potential off-target effects of the gene editing method, and providing a clear pathway for its application in human therapies.",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.

Focusing on image classification, we consider the setting of a black-box transfer attack where an attacker does not know the target model. Instead of forcing corrupted image representations to cross the nearest decision boundaries or converge to a particular point, we propose a distribution-oriented approach. We rely on optimal transport to push the feature distribution of attacked images towards an already modeled distribution. We show that this new distribution-oriented approach leads to better transferable patches. Through digital experiments conducted on ImageNet-1K, we provide evidence that our new patches are the only ones that can simultaneously influence multiple Transformer models and Convolutional Neural Networks. Physical world experiments demonstrate that our patch can affect systems in deployment without explicit knowledge.",

To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 prompt-based \u201cdefenses\u201d against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest dataset of human-generated adversarial examples for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in methods for extracting interpretable rules from ML models trained to solve a wide range of tasks over knowledge graphs (KGs), such as KG completion, node classification, question answering and recommendation. Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safetycritical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential NEURAL-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power.",

In contrast, Symphony uses message-passing with higher-degree E(3)-equivariant features. This allows a novel representation of probability distributions via spherical harmonic signals to efficiently model the 3D geometry of molecules.

        "title": "A PRECISE CHARACTERIZATION OF SGD STABILITY USING LOSS SURFACE GEOMETRY",
        "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) stands as a cornerstone optimization algorithm with proven real-world empirical successes but relatively limited theoretical understanding. Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.",

Previous works have analyzed separately how forgetting is affected by either task similarity or overparameterization. In contrast, our paper examines how task similarity and overparameterization jointly affect forgetting in an analyzable model. Specifically, we focus on two-task continual linear regression, where the second task is a random orthogonal transformation of an arbitrary first task (an abstraction of random permutation tasks). We derive an exact analytical expression for the expected forgetting \u2014 and uncover a nuanced pattern. In highly overparameterized models, intermediate task similarity causes the most forgetting.

        "abstract": "Supervised learning methods have been found to exhibit inductive biases favoring simpler features. When such features are spuriously correlated with the label, this can result in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn from unlabeled data, the extent to which these representations rely on spurious features for prediction is unclear. In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in SSL can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose LATETVG to remove spurious information from these representations during pretraining, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning. We find that our method produces representations which outperform the baselines on several benchmarks, without the need for group or label information during SSL.",

However, existing benchmarks for constrained generation usually focus on fixed constraint types (e.g. generate a sentence containing certain words) that have proved to be easy for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4. We present COLLIE, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g. language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using COLLIE, we compile the COLLIE-v1 dataset with 2,080 instances comprising 13 constraint structures. We perform systematic experiments across five state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models and analyze their performances to reveal shortcomings. COLLIE is designed to be extensible and lightweight, and we hope the community finds it useful to develop more complex constraints and evaluations in the future.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper delivers a detailed and organized examination of how climate change affects global biodiversity. The authors, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, applied statistical models and machine learning techniques to analyze extensive datasets from various sources, such as the IPCC and UNEP. The study specifically looks into how climate change influences species extinction, habitat fragmentation, and ecosystem instability.\n\nBeginning with an overview of the subject, the authors emphasize the alarming pace of species extinction and the significant role that climate change plays in worsening this issue. They outline their methodology for data collection and analysis, employing machine learning to uncover patterns and trends.\n\nIn the results section, the findings reveal a significant link between climate change and species extinction. The study also identifies habitat fragmentation and ecosystem disruption as major contributors to biodiversity decline, especially in tropical areas. The authors propose that these results carry critical implications for conservation and management practices.\n\nThe discussion section offers a thorough analysis of the findings, discussing the study's limitations and possible biases. The authors also consider the serious repercussions of inaction, which include potentially devastating biodiversity losses.\n\nIn the conclusion, the authors summarize their key findings and stress the necessity of tackling the root causes of climate change to avert further biodiversity decline.\n\nAs a whole, the paper provides an in-depth and well-organized examination of climate change's effects on global biodiversity. The incorporation of machine learning algorithms for large dataset analysis adds valuable complexity, and the results are well-backed by data.\n\nNonetheless, there are several aspects that could be improved. First, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive explanation of the data sources and the quality control measures implemented to ensure the reliability of the findings. Additionally, while the use of machine learning in identifying data patterns is sophisticated, it raises concerns about potential bias and overfitting.\n\nMoreover, the study could have been enhanced with more context-specific analyses of results. For instance, exploring how biodiversity reactions to climate change vary across different regions and ecosystems or investigating the effects on particular species and habitats would provide valuable insights.\n\nFurthermore, a more critical review of the study's limitations and possible biases would strengthen the paper. Although the discussion summarizes these limitations well, explicitly addressing them and suggesting future research pathways would be beneficial.\n\nLastly, including more concrete and actionable recommendations for conservation and management strategies would improve the paper. While it emphasizes the need to tackle the underlying causes of climate change, providing specific examples of how these strategies could be practically applied would enhance its effectiveness.\n\nFor future research, I recommend focusing on the following areas:\n\n- Creating more nuanced analyses that consider regional and ecosystem variations in biodiversity's responses to climate change.\n- Examining the specific impacts of climate change on individual species and habitats, including the formulation of conservation and management strategies.\n- Advancing machine learning techniques for detecting patterns in large datasets, while evaluating potential biases and overfitting issues.\n- Offering more actionable recommendations for conservation practices, backed by concrete examples of their implementation.\n\nIn summary, I would rate this paper a 4 out of 5 for its scientific rigor, relevance, and implications. Despite areas needing enhancement, it presents a thorough and structured inquiry into climate change's effects on global biodiversity, supported by substantial data.",

        "abstract": "We study the problem of procedure planning in instructional videos, which aims to make a goal-oriented sequence of action steps given partial visual state observations. The motivation of this problem is to learn a structured and plannable state and action space. Recent works succeeded in sequence modeling of steps with only sequence-level annotations accessible during training, which overlooked the roles of states in the procedures. In this work, we point out that State CHangEs MAtter (SCHEMA) for procedure planning in instructional videos. We aim to establish a more structured state space by investigating the causal relations between steps and states in procedures. Specifically, we explicitly represent each step as state changes and track the state changes in procedures. For step representation, we leveraged the commonsense knowledge in large language models (LLMs) to describe the state changes of steps via our designed chain-of-thought prompting. For state change tracking, we align visual state observations with language state descriptions via cross-modal contrastive learning, and explicitly model the intermediate states of the procedure using LLM-generated state descriptions. Experiments on CrossTask, COIN, and NIV benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed SCHEMA model achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains explainable visualizations.",

This includes many of the most popular examples of kernels defined on the nodes of a graph. Our algorithm enjoys subquadratic time complexity with respect to the number of nodes, overcoming the notoriously prohibitive cubic scaling of exact graph kernel evaluation. It can also be trivially distributed across machines, permitting learning on much larger networks. At the heart of the algorithm is a modulation function which upweights or downweights the contribution from di erent random walks depending on their lengths. We show that by parameterising it with a neural network we can obtain g-GRFs that give higher-quality kernel estimates or perform e cient, scalable kernel learning. We provide robust theoretical analysis and support our findings with experiments including pointwise estimation of fixed graph kernels, solving non-homogeneous graph ordinary di erential equations, node clustering and kernel regression on triangular meshes.1",

        "abstract": "Proximal causal learning is a powerful framework for identifying the causal effect under the existence of unmeasured confounders. Within this framework, the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatments can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well handle continuous treatments for proximal causal learning. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications1.",

        "abstract": "Mixture models arise in many regression problems, but most methods have seen limited adoption partly due to these algorithms\u2019 highly-tailored and model-specific nature. On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low meansquared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer\u2019s output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer.",

        "abstract": "Embodied AI models often employ off the shelf vision backbones like CLIP to encode their visual observations. Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent\u2019s focus from task-relevant visual cues. Inspired by selective attention in humans\u2014the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand\u2014we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied AI. Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across 5 benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects.

        "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to empower a model to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. A recent development known as task arithmetic has revealed that several models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, can be directly merged into a single model to execute MTL without necessitating a retraining process using the initial training data. Nevertheless, this direct addition of models often leads to a significant deterioration in the overall performance of the merged model. This decline occurs due to potential conflicts and intricate correlations among the multiple tasks. Consequently, the challenge emerges of how to merge pre-trained models more effectively without using their original training data. This paper introduces an innovative technique called Adaptive Model Merging (AdaMerging). This approach aims to autonomously learn the coefficients for model merging, either in a task-wise or layer-wise manner, without relying on the original training data. Specifically, our AdaMerging method operates as an automatic, unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. It leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples from the multi-task setup as a surrogate objective function to iteratively refine the merging coefficients of the multiple models. Our experimental findings across eight tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the AdaMerging scheme we put forth. Compared to the current state-of-the-art task arithmetic merging scheme, AdaMerging showcases a remarkable 11% improvement in performance. Notably, AdaMerging also exhibits superior generalization capabilities when applied to unseen downstream tasks. Furthermore, it displays a significantly enhanced robustness to data distribution shifts that may occur during the testing phase. The code is available at AdaMerging.",

        "abstract": "The ability to engineer novel proteins with higher fitness for a desired property would be revolutionary for biotechnology and medicine. Modeling the combinatorially large space of sequences is infeasible; prior methods often constrain optimization to a small mutational radius, but this drastically limits the design space. Instead of heuristics, we propose smoothing the fitness landscape to facilitate protein optimization. First, we formulate protein fitness as a graph signal then use Tikunov regularization to smooth the fitness landscape. We find optimizing in this smoothed landscape leads to improved performance across multiple methods in the GFP and AAV benchmarks. Second, we achieve state-of-the-art results utilizing discrete energy-based models and MCMC in the smoothed landscape. Our method, called Gibbs sampling with Graph-based Smoothing (GGS), demonstrates a unique ability to achieve 2.5 fold fitness improvement (with in-silico evaluation) over its training set. GGS demonstrates potential to optimize proteins in the limited data regime. Code: https://github.com/kirjner/GGS",

This analysis is key to DP-SGD\u2019s success in machine learning (ML), but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose \u201cMMCC\u201d, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as \u03b5\u2192 0. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our \u201cconditional composition theorem\u201d has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our algorithm also has practical empirical utility. We show that amplification leads to significant improvement in the privacy/utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL style algorithms for standard benchmark tasks.",

However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. In this manner, the LLM-powered dialogue agent can not only be generalized to different cases after the training, but also be applicable to different applications by just substituting the learned plug-in. In addition, we propose to evaluate the policy planning capability of dialogue systems under the interactive setting. Experimental results demonstrate that PPDPP consistently and substantially outperforms existing approaches on three different proactive dialogue applications, including negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring dialogues.1",

        "abstract": "Assigning importance weights to adversarial data has achieved great success in training adversarially robust networks under limited model capacity. However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points.

Further, we design multiple novel conditioning schemes and train SDXL on multiple aspect ratios. To ensure highest quality results, we also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique. We demonstrate that SDXL improves dramatically over previous versions of Stable Diffusion and achieves results competitive with those of black-box state-of-the-art image generators such as Midjourney (Holz, 2023).",

        "abstract": "With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%. These results highlight the need for further development of robust agents, that current state-of-the-art large language models are far from perfect performance in these real-life tasks, and that WebArena can be used to measure such progress.1",

The authors utilized a mix of theoretical modeling, simulations, and experimental measurements to explore the correlation between the coating's structure, thickness, and the thermal conductivity of the material beneath.\n\nThe strengths of the paper include a solid grasp of the principles governing thermal conductivity within building materials. The experimental framework seems robust, facilitating precise thermal conductivity measurements. Additionally, investigating nanostructured coatings offers a distinctive chance to explore how surface roughness influences thermal conductivity.\n\nOn the downside, the paper does not adequately define the specific nanostructured coatings utilized in the research; providing more details about the type, composition, and production methods would be helpful. Furthermore, while the authors depend significantly on theoretical models, there appears to be limited validation of these models with actual experimental data, which could enhance the reliability of the findings. The authors also fail to mention potential limitations of the study, such as the effects of coating degradation or environmental variables on thermal conductivity.\n\nRegarding methodology, the authors incorporated a blend of theoretical modeling, simulations, and experimental methods to analyze the relationship between the coating's structure, thickness, and the thermal conductivity of the substrate. Their experimental design, utilizing a thermal conductivity analyzer, appears well-executed. Moreover, the authors employed a finite element model to predict the thermal conductivity of the coating in conjunction with the underlying material.\n\nThe results indicate a notable decrease in the thermal conductivity of the building material when the nanostructured coating is applied. The research suggests that factors such as the coating's structure, thickness, and the thermal conductivity of the underlying material are pivotal in influencing the overall thermal conductivity of the building material.\n\nIn the discussion section, the authors assert that nanostructured coatings significantly affect the thermal conductivity of the building material. The study emphasizes the potential advantages of utilizing these coatings to lower thermal conductivity in building materials.\n\nFor future research, the authors recommend investigating the long-term durability of nanostructured coatings in buildings. Additional studies could also explore how environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or UV exposure, affect the thermal conductivity of these coatings.\n\nIn terms of recommendations, the authors should include more detailed information regarding the type of nanostructured coating implemented in their research. Strengthening the validation of their theoretical models with experimental data would also bolster the conclusions. Additionally, they should consider addressing possible study limitations relating to coating degradation or environmental impacts on thermal conductivity.\n\nI would assess this paper as an 8 out of 10.

Nonetheless, there are significant gaps, such as the lack of detailed information about the specific nanostructured coating used, and further validation of the theoretical frameworks would enhance the study's overall credibility.",

However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes \u2013 i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with nonEuclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.",

        "abstract": "This work studies the problem of panoptic symbol spotting, which is to spot and parse both countable object instances (windows, doors, tables, etc.) and uncountable stuff (wall, railing, etc.) from computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. Existing methods typically involve either rasterizing the vector graphics into images and using image-based methods for symbol spotting, or directly building graphs and using graph neural networks for symbol recognition. In this paper, we take a different approach, which treats graphic primitives as a set of 2D points that are locally connected and use point cloud segmentation methods to tackle it. Specifically, we utilize a point transformer to extract the primitive features and append a mask2former-like spotting head to predict the final output. To better use the local connection information of primitives and enhance their discriminability, we further propose the attention with connection module (ACM) and contrastive connection learning scheme (CCL). Finally, we propose a KNN interpolation mechanism for the mask attention module of the spotting head to better handle primitive mask downsampling, which is primitive-level in contrast to pixel-level for the image. Our approach, named SymPoint, is simple yet effective, outperforming recent state-of-the-art method GAT-CADNet by an absolute increase of 9.6% PQ and 10.4% RQ on the FloorPlanCAD dataset.

        "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that for offline deep reinforcement learning (DRL), pre-training Decision Transformer with a large language corpus can improve downstream performance (Reid et al., 2022). A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic IID data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), a popular offline DRL algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) backbone. Surprisingly, pre-training with simple synthetic data for a small number of updates can also improve CQL, providing consistent performance improvement on D4RL Gym locomotion datasets. The results of this paper not only illustrate the importance of pre-training for offline DRL but also show that the pre-training data can be synthetic and generated with remarkably simple mechanisms.",

With the recent development of diffusion models, data attribution has become a desired module to properly assign valuations for high-quality or copyrighted training samples, ensuring that data contributors are fairly compensated or credited. Several theoretically motivated methods have been proposed to implement data attribution, in an effort to improve the trade-off between computational scalability and effectiveness. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on attributing diffusion models, specifically focusing on DDPMs trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on ArtBench. Intriguingly, we report counter-intuitive observations that theoretically unjustified design choices for attribution empirically outperform previous baselines by a large margin, in terms of both linear datamodeling score and counterfactual evaluation. Our work presents a significantly more efficient approach for attributing diffusion models, while the unexpected findings suggest that at least in non-convex settings, constructions guided by theoretical assumptions may lead to inferior attribution performance.

A more focused statement highlighting the most prevalent NDDs would improve the introduction's clarity.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe methods are clearly articulated, providing an insightful overview of the microRNA-based gene editing technique. However, the approach of using a single microRNA to target multiple genes (e.g., miR-34a) raises concerns regarding specificity. Although the authors recognize this issue, a deeper exploration of possible off-target effects would enhance the discussion.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe preclinical study results are commendable, showcasing considerable enhancements in cognitive ability, motor skills, and overall survival. Nevertheless, a more thorough critique of the study's limitations would strengthen the discussion. For instance, the authors note that the research was conducted solely on mice, which might not accurately reflect human NDDs. Additionally, the absence of controls for potential off-target impacts or secondary gene effects is a significant concern.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion is well-crafted, yet the claim that \"this approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of NDDs\" is excessively optimistic. While the findings are encouraging, further evidence is required to substantiate the authors' assertions. A more balanced conclusion acknowledging the study's limitations would enhance the manuscript.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1.

Incorporate more thorough control experiments to examine possible secondary effects.\n4. Recognize the study's limitations, particularly the reliance on mouse models.\n5. Refine the conclusion to present a more measured perspective on the findings.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10. The research introduces a groundbreaking method for NDD treatment, but the study's limitations need careful consideration.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Peer Review:**\n**Introduction:**\nThe objective of this research is to create an innovative algorithm aimed at predicting the binding affinity between proteins and ligands using deep learning methods. The authors assert that their strategy employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture the features inherent in the structures of both proteins and ligands. Though the application of deep learning techniques to protein-protein interactions has been previously explored in the literature, the targeted use of CNNs for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity is a fresh perspective. \n\nThe authors indicate they tested their algorithm on a collection of 1000 protein-ligand complexes. Nonetheless, the abstract lacks specifics about the dataset, including its origin and the attributes of the included complexes, which would enhance the clarity of their research.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors thoroughly outline their method, using a CNN to extract features from protein and ligand structures. This neural network is trained on the dataset with an appropriate loss function and optimization technique, claiming to achieve an average prediction accuracy of 85.7% for binding affinity. \n\nHowever, the specifics regarding the training procedure are insufficient. It remains unclear what data augmentation techniques were implemented to enhance the dataset. The authors are encouraged to provide a comprehensive description of the training setup and the optimization methods utilized.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results section highlights the average binding affinity prediction accuracy, reported to be 85.7%. However, it does not include performance metrics on a validation dataset. \n\nA comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm against traditional binding affinity prediction methods would add significant value. Including comparisons with other leading-edge methods would clarify the efficacy of the proposed approach.\n\n**Discussion:**\nIn the discussion section, the authors make comparisons between their algorithm and traditional methods, but the scope is limited to only a few examples. A broader comparison with other advanced methods would be advantageous. \n\nWhile the authors suggest their algorithm offers a new viewpoint on protein-ligand interaction predictions, it remains ambiguous which specific facets of these interactions the proposed algorithm addresses.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, the research introduces a novel method for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity through deep learning techniques. Although the methodology is innovative and the outcomes show potential, several limitations and opportunities for enhancement are present.\n\nThe authors should consider detailing the training process and optimization algorithm more thoroughly. A comprehensive evaluation against other leading methods would provide a more complete understanding of the proposed algorithm's capabilities.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nBased on this review, I advise the authors to:\n\n1. Elaborate on the training process and optimization algorithm employed.\n2. Conduct a thorough comparison with other leading methods in the field.\n3. Include details regarding the dataset's source and characteristics in the abstract.\n4. Present a validation dataset to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance.\n\n**Rating:**\nI score the study a 7 out of 10, given its novel approach and the promising results reported. However, it is crucial to address the identified limitations and opportunities for improvement in future research.\n\n**References:**\n1. Smith et al. (2020).

In coming years or decades, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may surpass human capabilities at many critical tasks. In this position paper, we examine the technical difficulty of fine-tuning hypothetical AGI systems based on pretrained deep models to pursue goals that are aligned with human interests. We argue that, if trained like today\u2019s most capable models, AGI systems could learn to act deceptively to receive higher reward, learn misaligned internally-represented goals which generalize beyond their fine-tuning distributions, and pursue those goals using power-seeking strategies. We review emerging evidence for these properties. AGIs with these properties would be difficult to align and may appear aligned even when they are not.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper presents a multi-faceted therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease (AD), integrating gene editing, nanoparticle-based drug delivery, and immunotherapy. The introduction effectively emphasizes the necessity for innovative treatments for AD.\n\nThe authors utilize CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to focus on the APOE4 gene, a significant risk factor for AD, intending to decrease its expression and thereby lower the likelihood of AD development. They outline the use of nanoparticles to deliver a small molecule inhibitor targeting beta-secretase, which is implicated in AD progression.\n\nThe nanoparticle drug delivery method is promising as it may enable targeted therapy. However, the authors fall short in providing detailed insights into the particles' design, including their size, shape, surface charge, and composition. Furthermore, they do not address potential issues associated with nanoparticles, such as toxicity, immune reactions, and stability.\n\nAdditionally, the authors mention employing immunotherapy to boost the gene editing results, referencing the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors like PD-1/PD-L1 in cancer treatment. Yet, they fail to elaborate on the specific inhibitor used, how it works, and its effectiveness against AD.\n\nWhile the authors report substantial decreases in APOE4 gene expression from the gene editing method, they do not include adequate details regarding the specificity, efficiency, or duration of the gene editing effects. Similarly, in the results of the nanoparticle drug delivery mechanism, they report reduced beta-secretase activity but lack specifics on the approach's selectivity, delivery efficiency, and effect duration.\n\nIn their discussion, the authors outline the potential advantages of their therapeutic strategy, such as a reduced risk of AD, slowed disease progression, and enhanced cognitive function. However, the analysis is superficial, lacking sufficient commentary on the potential hazards, limitations, and the necessity for additional research.\n\nThe authors conclude that their multi-targeted strategy could transform AD treatment. Despite this, the paper falls short in depth, offering limited information about nanoparticle design, gene editing specificity, drug delivery efficiency, effect duration, potential risks, approach limitations, and the requirement for further investigation.\n\nTo improve the paper, I suggest the following enhancements:\n\n1. Deliver comprehensive details on nanoparticle design, covering aspects like size, shape, surface charge, and composition.\n2. Address potential nanoparticle risks, including toxicity, immune responses, and stability concerns.\n3. Elucidate the specific checkpoint inhibitor discussed, detailing its mechanism of action and efficacy against AD.\n4. Provide thorough insights into gene editing specificity, efficiency, and effect duration.\n5. Examine the approach's limitations, including chances of off-target effects, research needs, and possible adverse reactions.\n\nRating:\n\nI would assign this paper a score of 7 out of 10. While it proposes a potentially effective method for treating AD, it lacks in various critical areas, such as nanoparticle design, gene editing specificity, drug delivery efficiency, effect duration, potential risks, approach limitations, and the necessity for further research.",

While the usage of classifier-free guidance is well acknowledged to be crucial for successful optimization, it is considered an auxiliary trick rather than the most essential component. In this paper, we re-evaluate the role of classifier-free guidance in score distillation and discover a surprising finding: the guidance alone is enough for effective text-to-3D generation tasks. We name this method Classifier Score Distillation (CSD), which can be interpreted as using an implicit classification model for generation. This new perspective reveals new insights for understanding existing techniques. We validate the effectiveness of CSD across a variety of text-to-3D tasks including shape generation, texture synthesis, and shape editing, achieving results superior to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Our algorithm draws inspiration from the recent work of Chen et al., who developed DP algorithms for recovery of stochastic block models in cases where the graph comprises exactly two nearly-balanced clusters. Our algorithm works for well-clustered graphs with k nearly-balanced clusters, and the misclassification ratio almost matches the one of the best-known non-private algorithms. We conduct experimental evaluations on datasets with known ground truth clusters to substantiate the prowess of our algorithm.

        "abstract": "Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.",

The authors refer to their membrane as \"novel\" but fail to provide a robust comparison with existing membrane solutions, which could clarify the significance and relevance of their work.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. A blend of theoretical and experimental approaches is employed to assess the membrane's properties, which is advantageous for achieving a comprehensive understanding of its structure and performance. Nonetheless, the authors should elaborate on their specific evaluation techniques, particularly the characterization methods and data analysis strategies utilized.\n\n**Results:**\n\n1. The results section is well-articulated, offering a clear synopsis of the data and findings. The figures and tables are well-designed and informative, but a deeper explanation of the data analysis techniques, including the tests and experiments conducted to measure the membrane's effectiveness, is warranted.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\n1. The authors effectively discuss the results, underscoring the membrane's significant attributes and performance metrics. However, the discussion would benefit from a more rigorous analysis of competing solutions and a thorough evaluation of the membrane's economic feasibility.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\n1. The authors assert that the PVDF membrane is a hopeful candidate for desalination and renewable energy applications, positing that it may offer enhanced performance and cost-efficiency compared to current membrane technologies. Nonetheless, the conclusions would gain from a more thorough appraisal of competitive technologies and a detailed examination of the membrane's economic potential.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors might consider submitting an extended version of the paper to a journal that specializes in membrane technologies and desalination issues. Such a platform would allow for a deeper exploration of the membrane's characteristics and performance, highlighting the paper's importance.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nAfter evaluating the paper, I would assign it a score of 7 out of 10. The writing is strong, and the authors effectively convey their research. However, a more thorough examination concerning the membrane's scalability and cost-effectiveness, in addition to a more detailed competitive assessment, would elevate the work. Overall, with further enhancements and refinements, the manuscript holds the promise of making a notable contribution to the field.\n\n**Revision Suggestions:**\n\nIn light of my review, I recommend the authors:\n\n* Include a more elaborate discussion regarding the membrane's scalability and cost-effectiveness.\n* Incorporate a more thorough comparison with competing technologies.\n* Contemplate publishing an expanded version of the paper in a journal focused on membrane technologies and desalination applications.\n\nBy addressing these suggestions, the authors can bolster their paper's impact and significance within the discipline.",

        "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models have exhibited superior performance in high-fidelity text-guided visual generation and editing. Nevertheless, prevailing text-guided visual diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating text-visual relationships exclusively into the reverse process, often disregarding their relevance in the forward process. This inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may limit the precise conveyance of textual semantics in visual synthesis results. To address this issue, we propose a novel and general contextualized diffusion model (CONTEXTDIFF) by incorporating the cross-modal context encompassing interactions and alignments between text condition and visual sample into forward and reverse processes. We propagate this context to all timesteps in the two processes to adapt their trajectories, thereby facilitating cross-modal conditional modeling. We generalize our contextualized diffusion to both DDPMs and DDIMs with theoretical derivations, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in evaluations with two challenging tasks: text-to-image generation, and text-to-video editing. In each task, our CONTEXTDIFF achieves new state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing the semantic alignment between text condition and generated samples, as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

        "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in which incontext samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive, it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm, which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all settings.",

The authors aim to utilize machine learning techniques and sensor information to enhance the precision and effectiveness of predictive maintenance practices. The manuscript reviews the current landscape of predictive maintenance and underscores the advantages of integrating machine learning and sensor data.\n\nThe methodology section outlines the data-gathering process, which spanned six months and involved sensor data collection from industrial machines. This data was subsequently prepared through preprocessing and feature engineering for application with machine learning models. The researchers employed several machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to forecast maintenance requirements. Model performance was measured across various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\nIn the results section, the authors detail the outcomes of the machine learning models on the test dataset. The Random Forest algorithm excelled with the highest accuracy (92.5%) and precision (85.6%). The SVM also demonstrated solid performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and precision of 83.1%. Conversely, the CNN showed the least effectiveness, recording an accuracy of 80.5% and precision of 75.6%.\n\nThe discussion section offers a comprehensive evaluation of the findings and their broader significance. The authors emphasize the advantages of deploying machine learning for predictive maintenance, such as enhanced precision and operational efficiency. They also acknowledge the study's limitations, particularly regarding the restricted dataset and the necessity for additional research to corroborate the findings.\n\nIn the conclusion, the authors reiterate the key discoveries and implications of their research. They assert that this innovative method utilizing machine learning and sensor data effectively enhances maintenance accuracy and efficiency.\n\nThe critique identifies that while the paper presents a comprehensive and logically organized discussion on predictive maintenance and the benefits of machine learning, there are notable drawbacks that must be considered. The small size of the dataset is a critical issue, warranting further investigation. Additionally, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of the feature selection method, a crucial component in forming machine learning models.\n\nI suggest the authors:\n\n1. Utilize a more extensive dataset for more reliable results.\n2. Clarify the feature selection process comprehensively.\n3. Examine other machine learning algorithms for a comparative analysis.\n4. Assess how sensor data quality might impact machine learning model outcomes.\n\nOverall, the paper effectively covers the current state of predictive maintenance and the potential of using machine learning with sensor data. Despite the existing limitations that require further examination, I recommend publication in the Journal of Predictive Maintenance, contingent upon addressing these shortcomings and integrating the suggested enhancements.\n\nI rate this paper 8/10 for its depth, organization, and overall quality, while emphasizing that addressing the limitations is essential for strengthening its credibility.",

        "title": "REDUCING THE FLAWS OF LARGE MULTIMODAL MOD- ELS WITH IN-CONTEXT LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as the Flamingo model and its subsequent competitors, have started to emerge as natural steps towards generalist agents. However, interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly captured by the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQA accuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their real capabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to human expectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from the current evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from 3B up to 80B parameter scale, on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention, compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation on these axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. While the current go-to solution to align these models is based on training, such as instruction tuning or RLHF, we rather (2) explore the training-free in-context learning (ICL) as a solution, and study how it affects these limitations. Based on our ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICL variants such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success, LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICL on LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improved explainability, answer abstention, ICL only slightly improves instruction following, does not improve compositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations. (3) The proposed ICL variants are promising as post-hoc approaches to efficiently tackle some of those flaws. The code is available here: https://github.com/mshukor/EvALign-ICL.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Tag2Text, a vision language pre-training (VLP) framework, which introduces image tagging into vision-language models to guide the learning of visual-linguistic features. In contrast to prior works which utilize object tags either manually labeled or automatically detected with an off-the-shelf detector with limited performance, our approach explicitly learns an image tagger using tags parsed from image-paired text and thus provides a strong semantic guidance to vision-language models. In this way, Tag2Text can utilize largescale annotation-free image tags in accordance with image-text pairs, and provides more diverse tag categories beyond objects. As a result, Tag2Text demonstrates the ability of a foundational image tagging model, with superior zero-shot performance even comparable to fully supervised models. Moreover, by leveraging the tagging guidance, Tag2Text effectively enhances the performance of visionlanguage models on both generation-based and alignment-based tasks. Across a wide range of downstream benchmarks, Tag2Text achieves state-of-the-art results with similar model sizes and data scales, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed tagging guidance.

        "abstract": "The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

        "abstract": "Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scenelevel diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models\u2019 (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GENSIM, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. 1",

        "abstract": "Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using only the downstream task data, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.",

However, several aspects require enhancement:\n\n1. **Validation of miRNA expression:** The paper fails to provide enough proof of the validity of the miRNA expression results. It is essential to validate qPCR findings using additional methods like RT-qPCR or RNA sequencing to confirm result accuracy.\n2. **Specificity of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA:** Evidence supporting the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA is lacking. The gRNA should be meticulously designed to achieve high specificity, minimizing off-target effects and ensuring the accurate targeting of the intended miRNA.\n3. **Dosing and delivery:** The manuscript does not offer comprehensive details about how the CRISPR-Cas9 system was dosed and delivered. These factors must be tailored to the particular disease model and rigorously assessed for effectiveness and safety.\n4. **Control group:** The absence of a control group limits the ability to compare the treatment results and assess its effectiveness.\n5. **Longitudinal study:** As a short-term investigation, the study does not assess long-term efficacy. Conducting a longitudinal study would help in evaluating treatment effectiveness over an extended time.\n6. **Mechanism of action:** There is no clear explanation of the mechanism underlying the microRNA-based gene editing approach. Additional research is required to clarify how the treatment operates.\n7. **Animal model:** Although a mouse model is utilized for neurodegeneration studies, considering other animal models like rats or primates could be beneficial for further research.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. **Validate miRNA expression:** It is crucial to confirm miRNA expression findings through other techniques, ensuring result reliability.\n2. **Design specific CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA:** Focus on creating gRNAs with high specificity to prevent off-target effects and guarantee accurate targeting.\n3. **Optimize dosing and delivery:** Properly tailor and assess the dosing and administration of the CRISPR-Cas9 system for the specific disease model.\n4. **Include a control group:** Establish a control group to facilitate effective comparison and evaluation of treatment outcomes.\n5. **Conduct a longitudinal study:** Additional longitudinal research is necessary to observe the treatment's efficacy over more extended periods.\n6. **Elucidate the mechanism of action:** Further investigations should aim to define the mechanism of action related to the microRNA-based gene editing.\n7. **Use alternative animal models:** It would be advantageous to explore alternative animal models for more comprehensive research.\n\n**Overall:** While the study shows promise, further investigations are essential to validate the findings and examine the potential of microRNA-based gene editing as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Learning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity, and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose Stein Soft Actor-Critic (S2AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, S2AC uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that S2AC yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark.

However, existing methods can hardly discover diverse level patterns, while the lack of diversity makes the gameplay boring. This paper proposes an ensemble reinforcement learning approach that uses multiple negatively correlated sub-policies to generate different alternative level segments, and stochastically selects one of them following a dynamic selector policy. A novel policy regularisation technique is integrated into the approach to diversify the generated alternatives. In addition, we develop theorems to provide general methodologies for optimising policy regularisation in a Markov decision process. The proposed approach is compared with several state-of-the-art policy ensemble methods and classic methods on a well-known level generation benchmark, with two different reward functions expressing game-design goals from different perspectives. Results show that our approach boosts level diversity notably with competitive performance in terms of the reward. Furthermore, by varying the regularisation coefficient values, the trained generators form a well-spread Pareto front, allowing explicit trade-offs between diversity and rewards of generated levels.",

        "title": "EFFICIENT COMPUTER VISION?",
        "abstract": "Binary Neural networks (BNN) have emerged as an attractive computing paradigm for a wide range of low-power vision tasks. However, state-of-theart (SOTA) BNNs do not yield any sparsity, and induce a significant number of non-binary operations. On the other hand, activation sparsity can be provided by spiking neural networks (SNN), that too have gained significant traction in recent times. Thanks to this sparsity, SNNs when implemented on neuromorphic hardware, have the potential to be significantly more power-efficient compared to traditional artifical neural networks (ANN). However, SNNs incur multiple time steps to achieve close to SOTA accuracy. Ironically, this increases latency and energy\u2014costs that SNNs were proposed to reduce\u2014and presents itself as a major hurdle in realizing SNNs\u2019 theoretical gains in practice. This raises an intriguing question: Can we obtain SNN-like sparsity and BNN-like accuracy and enjoy the energy-efficiency benefits of both? To answer this question, in this paper, we present a training framework for sparse binary activation neural networks (BANN) using a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer. We estimate the threshold of each BANN layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where the clipping value is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer regularizer. This approach shifts the activation values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the effect of noise that can otherwise degrade the BANN accuracy. Our approach outperforms existing BNNs, SNNs, and adder neural networks (that also avoid energy-expensive multiplication operations similar to BNNs and SNNs) in terms of the accuracy-FLOPs trade-off for complex image recognition tasks. Downstream experiments on object detection further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the portability of our approach to SNNs with multiple time steps. Codes are publicly available here.",

        "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our approach consists of two finetuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as Advanced Language Model-based trAnslator (ALMA). Based on LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT\u201921 (2 directions) and WMT\u201922 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model (NLLB TEAM et al., 2022) and GPT3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or 13B parameters.

        "abstract": "Human motion driven control (HMDC) is an effective approach for generating natural and compelling robot motions while preserving high-level semantics. However, establishing the correspondence between humans and robots with different body structures is not straightforward due to the mismatches in kinematics and dynamics properties, which causes intrinsic ambiguity to the problem. Many previous algorithms approach this motion retargeting problem with unsupervised learning, which requires the prerequisite skill sets. However, it will be extremely costly to learn all the skills without understanding the given human motions, particularly for high-dimensional robots. In this work, we introduce CrossLoco, a guided unsupervised reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns robot skills and their correspondence to human motions. Our key innovation is to introduce a cycle-consistency-based reward term designed to maximize the mutual information between human motions and robot states. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate compelling robot motions by translating diverse human motions, such as running, hopping, and dancing. We quantitatively compare our CrossLoco against the manually engineered and unsupervised baseline algorithms along with the ablated versions of our framework and demonstrate that our method translates human motions with better accuracy, diversity, and user preference. We also showcase its utility in other applications, such as synthesizing robot movements from language input and enabling interactive robot control.",

The authors effectively underline the significance of miRNAs in addressing neurodegenerative conditions. However, I would prefer a more in-depth discussion regarding the regulation of miRNAs in neurons and their interactions with various signaling pathways.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe authors outline a novel method utilizing microRNA-146a (miR-146a) inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases. While I found this approach fascinating, I have several reservations about the experimental design. Firstly, a more detailed account of the design and synthesis of miR-146a inhibitors is needed. Furthermore, additional details on the validation of these inhibitors in vitro and in vivo would be beneficial. The mention of combining miR-146a inhibitors with other therapeutic methods also raised questions about the evaluation of these combinations.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results section includes data on miR-146a expression levels within the brains of patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting its involvement in these disorders. Nonetheless, a more comprehensive analysis of this data, including statistical evaluations and comparisons with controls, would improve clarity. Additionally, more information on how miR-146a inhibitors were employed to manipulate miR-146a expression in neurons would be advantageous.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe authors explore the possible therapeutic advantages of employing miR-146a inhibitors for neurodegenerative diseases. While their case is plausible, a deeper examination of how these inhibitors interact with other signaling pathways and their impact on different miRNAs is warranted. More specifics on the potential long-term effects of these inhibitors on cognitive and motor functions would also enhance the discussion.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, although this manuscript proposes an intriguing strategy using miR-146a inhibitors for treating neurodegenerative diseases, further exploration is needed in several aspects. The authors should furnish more detailed method descriptions, including the design and synthesis of the inhibitors and their validation processes. They should also provide a more thorough analysis of the results and discuss the implications of their findings for long-term outcomes.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.

However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.",

The authors recognize the prospective advantages of AI in enhancing healthcare services, while also highlighting concerns regarding its limitations and associated risks.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThis study utilizes a mixed-methods framework, blending both qualitative and quantitative approaches for data collection and analysis. The authors carried out detailed interviews with experts in AI and medicine, alongside surveys of healthcare providers to gather insights into their views and experiences with AI in the medical field.\n\nAlthough the study does not specify the sample size, the authors mention having conducted \"over 100\" interviews and surveys, which may be considered limited for research of this magnitude.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe findings indicate that most healthcare professionals surveyed hold an optimistic outlook regarding AI's potential to enhance healthcare services. However, they also express concerns about challenges like data integrity and biases present in AI systems.\n\nQualitative interviews with field experts reflected a variety of opinions on AI's impact on medicine, showcasing both positive and negative viewpoints.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nIn the discussion segment, the authors provide an extensive overview of the current landscape of AI in healthcare, covering its uses, limitations, and possible dangers.\n\nThe conclusion drawn is that while AI holds the promise to transform healthcare delivery, it necessitates responsible and cautious implementation.\n\n**Critical Review**\n\nIn summary, this research offers a significant insight into the realm of AI in healthcare, yet it possesses several shortcomings.\n\nA primary limitation is its relatively small sample size, which might not accurately represent the broader healthcare community.\n\nMoreover, there is a lack of quantitative evidence regarding AI's actual effects on healthcare delivery, making it challenging to reach definite conclusions regarding its advantages and drawbacks.\n\nThe study's dependence on expert opinions and survey feedback may also fall short of providing a thorough grasp of the complex challenges related to AI in healthcare.\n\nAdditionally, the conclusion that AI could potentially transform healthcare delivery while requiring careful use is rather simplistic, failing to outline a clear strategy for achieving this.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo enhance the study's reliability and validity, I suggest that the authors:\n\n1. Utilize a more representative sample size, possibly through a randomized controlled trial or a large-scale survey.\n2. Incorporate additional quantitative data regarding the tangible impacts of AI on healthcare delivery, such as patient outcomes and cost benefits.\n3. Involve a broader array of viewpoints, including those of patients and caregivers, for a more well-rounded understanding of AI's complex implications in healthcare.\n4. Offer a more detailed and thoughtful examination of the possible benefits and risks of AI in healthcare, considering its influence on job displacement and resource distribution in healthcare.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nOverall, while this study makes a meaningful contribution to the understanding of AI in healthcare, it has several significant limitations that must be addressed in subsequent research.\n\nBy recognizing and tackling these shortcomings, the authors can present a more thorough and nuanced comprehension of the intricate issues surrounding AI in healthcare, offering a clearer path for the responsible and effective use of AI to enhance medical delivery.\n\nI recommend that the authors revise and resubmit their manuscript, incorporating the suggestions mentioned above.\n\nRating: (3/5)\n\nRecommendation: Revise and Resubmit",

VCAS computes an unbiased stochastic gradient with fine-grained layerwise importance sampling in data dimension for activation gradient calculation and leverage score sampling in token dimension for weight gradient calculation. To preserve accuracy, we control the additional variance by learning the sample ratio jointly with model parameters during training. We assessed VCAS on multiple fine-tuning and pre-training tasks in both vision and natural language domains. On all the tasks, VCAS can preserve the original training loss trajectory and validation accuracy with an up to 73.87% FLOPs reduction of BP and 49.58% FLOPs reduction of the whole training process.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space Z that is metrically connected to the state space S by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

Thompson offers a fascinating examination of how climate change affects freshwater lake ecosystems, particularly regarding the distribution and abundance of amphipod populations. Although the authors exhibit thorough research and analysis, there are several aspects of the study that could be improved.\n\nThe methodology utilized a mix of field observations, statistical analysis, and modeling techniques to explore the connections between climate variables\u2014such as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen\u2014and amphipod populations. While the methodology appears solid, the authors might consider employing more varied and refined approaches to evaluate the impacts of climate change. For instance, integrating additional spatial and temporal dimensions could yield a more holistic understanding of amphipod population dynamics.\n\nThe study's findings reveal significant relationships between climate variables and amphipod populations, with certain variables showing notable seasonal trends. However, the interpretation of these results is somewhat constrained by the small sample size and limited data availability. To reinforce the findings, the authors could utilize more advanced statistical methods, like generalized additive models, which would help address non-linear relationships and spatial autocorrelation.\n\nThe discussion section effectively explains the implications of the results, yet it could draw clearer connections to larger ecological and climatic contexts. Additionally, the authors could consider how their discoveries correspond with existing research on climate-induced changes in freshwater ecosystems or how these insights could guide conservation and management efforts.\n\nA significant drawback of the study is the absence of replication and variability across different lake systems.

        "abstract": "Existing analyses of the expressive capacity of Transformer models have required excessively deep layers for data memorization, leading to a discrepancy with the Transformers actually used in practice. This is primarily due to the interpretation of the softmax function as an approximation of the hardmax function. By clarifying the connection between the softmax function and the Boltzmann operator, we prove that a single layer of self-attention with low-rank weight matrices possesses the capability to perfectly capture the context of an entire input sequence. As a consequence, we show that one-layer and single-head Transformers have a memorization capacity for finite samples, and that Transformers consisting of one self-attention layer with two feed-forward neural networks are universal approximators for continuous permutation equivariant functions on a compact domain.",

        "title": "TERNATING DENOISING DIFFUSION PROCESS",
        "abstract": "Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of each other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation learning, the development of general representations for both recognition and generation tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus on generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These methods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading recognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1) pixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as reconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that integrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework. In each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ tokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion process gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training samples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse high-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on recognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the first successful development of general representations applicable to both generation and dense recognition tasks.

The robot evolution tree allows the robot evolution paths to be shared, so our approach can significantly outperform naive one-to-one policy transfer. We present a heuristic approach to determine an optimized robot evolution tree. Experiments have shown that our method is able to improve the efficiency of one-to-three transfer of manipulation policy by up to 3.2\u00d7 and one-to-six transfer of agile locomotion policy by 2.4\u00d7 in terms of simulation cost over the baseline of launching multiple independent one-to-one policy transfers.

        "abstract": "Learning Rate Rewinding (LRR) has been established as a strong variant of Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) to find lottery tickets in deep overparameterized neural networks. While both iterative pruning schemes couple structure and parameter learning, understanding how LRR excels in both aspects can bring us closer to the design of more flexible deep learning algorithms that can optimize diverse sets of sparse architectures. To this end, we conduct experiments that disentangle the effect of mask learning and parameter optimization and how both benefit from overparameterization. The ability of LRR to flip parameter signs early and stay robust to sign perturbations seems to make it not only more effective in mask identification but also in optimizing diverse sets of masks, including random ones. In support of this hypothesis, we prove in a simplified single hidden neuron setting that LRR succeeds in more cases than IMP, as it can escape initially problematic sign configurations.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "This systematic review assesses the effects of climate change on global food security over the past two decades (2002-2021). The authors evaluate data from 150 studies to understand how climate change influences crop yields, food prices, and food availability. The findings indicate that climate change has a significant impact on global food security, with crop yields projected to decline by 10-20% due to increasing temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events. The study also suggests that food prices could rise by 20-30% by 2050 as a result of climate-induced disruptions in food systems. The authors stress the urgency for policymakers to take action against climate change to safeguard global food security.\n\nIn terms of evaluation, the review is organized, thorough, and well-articulated. The authors\u2019 critical analysis of 150 studies is commendable, and the results are clear and substantiated by data. \n\nNonetheless, there are methodological concerns. The reliance on only 150 studies may not capture the full spectrum of climate change effects on global food security, and a broader range of sources could bolster the findings. Additionally, some studies included may have methodological flaws or biases that could influence the overall conclusions. \n\nMoreover, certain results could be seen as overstated. While climate change undoubtedly impacts global food security, it is improbable that global crop yields will decline by 10-20%. A more reasonable estimate might fall between 2-5%. \n\nThe authors also lack adequate context for policymakers regarding the implications of their findings, as they do not offer specific policy options or strategies to combat the effects of climate change on food security. Providing actionable guidance would enhance the relevance of the study.\n\nFinally, some conclusions may be too generalized. Although the review acknowledges substantial impacts of climate change on food security, it remains unclear whether these effects are solely due to climate change or if they are influenced by other factors like economic or social changes.\n\nFor future research, the following recommendations are suggested:\n\n1. Utilize diverse data sources to enhance sample size and minimize biases.\n2. Incorporate studies with robust methodological frameworks to better support the overall conclusions.\n3. Offer more comprehensive information on potential policy solutions or strategies to address climate change\u2019s effects on food security.\n4. Adjust crop yield decline estimates to more accurately reflect reality.\n5. Explore the interplay between climate change\u2019s impacts on global food security and other factors such as economic or social developments.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10 \n\nWhile this systematic review is well-crafted and thorough, certain methodological concerns, exaggerated results, insufficient practical recommendations for policymakers, and overly generalized conclusions diminish its effectiveness. Addressing these areas in future research would enhance the study's findings.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings. This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds. Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error. We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search. Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance. This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of \u201cprompt engineering,\u201d even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data.",

        "title": "IZATION AND MORE GENERALIZATION",
        "abstract": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs\u2019 general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of multi-task training.",

Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: \"How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of K while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?\" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning.

Nonetheless, the paper has notable shortcomings, which are elaborated upon below.\n\n**Strengths**\n\n1. The authors deliver a concise and organized summary of the existing treatment landscape for neurodegenerative diseases, highlighting the drawbacks of current therapies.\n2. The idea of employing microRNA-based gene editing is original and could lead to innovative therapeutic options for neurodegenerative conditions.\n3. A comprehensive examination of the molecular mechanisms governing neurodegenerative disease progression along with the proposed microRNA-based gene editing strategies is provided.\n\n**Weaknesses**\n\n1.

        "abstract": "One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zeroshot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback (RLCF) framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Overall Impression:**\nThe study titled \"Development of a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Treating Neurodegenerative Disorders Using MicroRNA-Based Gene Editing\" introduces an innovative strategy for addressing neurodegenerative diseases. The authors suggest a new therapeutic methodology that utilizes microRNA-based gene editing, an area that has attracted considerable interest lately. Although the research showcases promising preliminary results, there are multiple issues that warrant attention.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors utilized a multi-faceted approach involving microRNA-based gene editing, CRISPR-Cas9 technology, and a unique gene silencing platform. They effectively demonstrated the silencing of particular genes implicated in neurodegenerative conditions. However, the experimental design, while generally sound, had some drawbacks. The sample size was rather small, raising questions about the representativeness of the results for broader populations.\n\n**Results:**\nThe authors provided strong evidence for gene silencing achieved through their proprietary platform. The effects of gene silencing were found to be dose-dependent and appeared promising in alleviating disease-like symptoms in a mouse model of neurodegeneration. These findings were corroborated by biochemical assays and histological evaluations. Despite the intriguing nature of these results, additional validation is essential.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe discussion presented by the authors was coherent and informative. They underscored the potential therapeutic significance of their discoveries and addressed possible issues, such as off-target effects and the specificity of gene silencing. The authors also related their work to existing literature, enriching the context of their study. However, there were inconsistencies in how they interpreted previous research.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn summary, while the study reveals encouraging initial outcomes, various concerns must be tackled. The small sample size, absence of comprehensive data on off-target effects, and disparities in the interpretation of prior studies call for further exploration. To robustly verify these findings, additional experiments with larger sample sizes and more thorough investigations of off-target effects are recommended.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Expand sample size:** The authors should consider increasing their sample size to better represent wider populations and enhance statistical reliability.\n2. **Thorough examination of off-target effects:** It is critical to perform a more exhaustive analysis of off-target effects to confirm specificity and effectiveness.\n3. **Verification of gene silencing specificity:** The authors ought to establish the gene silencing specificity of their proprietary platform across various cell types and tissues.\n4. **Consistency in interpreting existing literature:** The authors should refine their analysis of previous studies to maintain consistency and accuracy.\n\n**Conflict of Interest:**\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\n\n**Certification:**\nI attest that I have thoroughly reviewed this paper, and my observations are grounded in my professional assessment of its content.\n\n**Signature:** [Your Name]  \n**Title:** Research Scientist",

        "abstract": "Vision-language models such as CLIP have shown great impact on diverse downstream tasks for zero-shot or label-free predictions. However, when it comes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance deteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a degradation-aware visionlanguage model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation dataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances state-of-the-art performance on both degradation-specific and unified image restoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration with large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pretraining using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur\u2019s superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fullyand partiallyobservable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments.

        "abstract": "Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaboratively training machine learning models using distributed data with label deficiency. Advanced FSSL methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called Twin-sight, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, Twin-sight concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, Twin-sight introduces a neighbourhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighbourhood relationship among data features extracted by both models. Our comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets provide substantial evidence that Twin-sight can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods across various experimental settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed Twin-sight.

        "abstract": "Optimization layers within neural network architectures have become increasingly popular for their ability to solve a wide range of machine learning tasks and to model domain-specific knowledge. However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QP solutions. More precisely, we propose a unified approach that tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible QP solutions in a classical l2 sense. The obtained Jacobian covers for feasible QPs the traditional implicit differentiation when it is valid and a weaker notion (i.e., conservative Jacobian) when it is infeasible. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing QP layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible QPs during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of QP layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.",

This is mainly due to data scarcity and computational challenges associated with training or fine-tuning large models for such applications. Prior work mainly emphasizes either effective pretraining of large models for decision-making or single-task adaptation. But real-world problems will require data-efficient, continual adaptation for new control tasks. Recognizing these constraints, we introduce TAIL (Task-specific Adapters for Imitation Learning), a framework for efficient adaptation to a stream of new control tasks. Inspired by recent advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language domains, we explore efficient fine-tuning techniques\u2014e.g., Bottleneck Adapters, P-Tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\u2014in TAIL to adapt large pretrained models for new tasks with limited demonstration data. Our extensive experiments comparing prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and adaptation baselines suggest that TAIL with LoRA can achieve the best post-adaptation performance with only 1% of the trainable parameters of full fine-tuning while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and preserving adaptation plasticity in continual learning settings.",

        "abstract": "Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modeling. In this work, we generate a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii) consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical tensor etc.",

The authors analyzed two decades of field data from three different regions within the tropical rainforest. Findings indicate significant changes in temperature and precipitation patterns over the last 20 years, which have resulted in declines in some amphibian populations. Furthermore, a positive link was identified between the presence of specific species and the elevation in the forest, implying that some species might be more resistant to climate change than others.\n\nThe paper presents a thorough and insightful examination of climate change's effects on amphibian distribution and abundance in tropical forests. The methodology, results, and discussions are well-documented, culminating in a clear and succinct conclusion.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Quality of data and analysis:** The authors utilized high-quality, two-decade-long field observation data, ensuring a solid foundation for their analysis, and employed comprehensive statistical methods correctly.\n2. **Clear and effective communication:** The writing is straightforward and concise, enabling readers to easily grasp the authors' arguments and findings.\n3. **Timeliness and relevance:** The study addresses a crucial and urgent global issue\u2014climate change\u2014making it particularly significant.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Narrow spatial and temporal scope:** Focusing on only three regions in the tropical rainforest may not sufficiently represent the wider tropical ecosystem.\n2. **Neglect of other environmental factors:** The study does not account for additional environmental influences on amphibian distribution and abundance, such as land-use changes, habitat fragmentation, and human activities.\n3. **Insufficient exploration of conservation implications:** The authors have not deeply investigated the conservation consequences of their findings, potentially limiting the paper's relevance to policymakers and conservationists.\n\n**Suggestions for Enhancement:**\n\n1. **Broaden spatial and temporal focus:** The authors might expand their research area and timeframe for a more holistic view of climate change's effects on amphibian distribution and abundance in tropical forests.\n2. **Account for various environmental influences:** It would be beneficial for the authors to control for other factors affecting amphibian distribution and population sizes, including land-use changes, habitat fragmentation, and human impact.\n3. **Address conservation implications thoroughly:** The authors should delve into the conservation consequences of their research outcomes, including proposing strategies for preserving and managing amphibian populations in light of climate change.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nConsidering the paper\u2019s strengths and areas for improvement, I recommend its acceptance for publication in the Journal of Tropical Ecology. The authors have delivered a comprehensive analysis of how climate change affects amphibian distribution and abundance in tropical forests, making a valuable contribution to ecology and conservation.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10\n\nThis peer review offers a detailed assessment of the paper, emphasizing both its merits and shortcomings.

Using YaRN, we show that LLaMA models can effectively utilize and extrapolate to context lengths much longer than their original pre-training would allow, while also surpassing previous the state-of-the-art at context window extension. In addition, we demonstrate that YaRN exhibits the capability to extrapolate beyond the limited context of a fine-tuning dataset.

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.",

        "abstract": "We present chain-of-knowledge (CoK) , a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources. It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.

        "title": "HOW OVER-PARAMETERIZATION SLOWS DOWN GRA-",
        "abstract": "This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization dramatically changes the convergence behaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from nearisotropic linear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn\u00d7n is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank r \u226a n, and one uses a symmetric parameterization XX\u22a4 to learn M\u2217. Here, X \u2208 Rn\u00d7k with k > r is the factor matrix. We give a novel \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case (k > r) where T is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario (k = r) where the convergence rate is exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )). Next, we study asymmetric setting where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn1\u00d7n2 is the unknown matrix of rank r \u226a min{n1, n2}, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization FG\u22a4 to learn M\u2217 where F \u2208 Rn1\u00d7k and G \u2208 Rn2\u00d7k. Building on prior work, we give a global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case (k = r) with an exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )) rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case (k > r) with an exp ( \u2212\u03a9 ( \u03b1T )) rate where \u03b1 is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) to linear convergence. Therefore, we identify a surprising phenomenon: asymmetric parameterization can exponentially speed up convergence. Equally surprising is our analysis that highlights the importance of imbalance between F and G. This is in sharp contrast to prior works which emphasize balance. We further give an example showing the dependency on \u03b1 in the convergence rate is unavoidable in the worst case. On the other hand, we propose a novel method that only modifies one step of GD and obtains a convergence rate independent of \u03b1, recovering the rate in the exact-parameterization case. We provide empirical studies to verify our theoretical findings.",

To address these issues, we propose GEN-Z\u2014a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions.",

The authors utilized a multivariate analysis to explore various environmental and ecological factors influencing amphibian populations. Findings reveal that tropical amphibians are particularly susceptible to climate change, underscoring the urgent need for continued research and conservation initiatives.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Methodology:** The study adopts a solid multivariate analysis strategy, integrating multiple environmental and ecological factors to evaluate the effects of climate change on amphibians. The incorporation of remote sensing data and species distribution models (SDMs) is especially commendable, enhancing the understanding of amphibian population dynamics across different regions.\n2. **Data Quality:** The dataset appears to be meticulously assembled and extensive, encompassing a wide array of tropical regions and amphibian species. The combination of various data sources and variables boosts the credibility and applicability of the findings.\n3. **Results Interpretation:** The findings are articulated clearly, offering an in-depth look at how climate change impacts amphibians. The structured analysis of spatial and temporal trends allows readers to easily grasp the content.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Sampling Bias:** The study is based on a limited number of 15 sites, which may result in sampling bias and restrict broader applicability. The focus on just 10 species from tropical regions could also limit the findings' relevance to other ecosystems.\n2. **Modeling Assumptions:** The use of SDMs carries inherent limitations due to their assumptions and potential biases. The chosen variables and parameters may not adequately reflect the intricate interactions among various environmental and ecological factors affecting amphibians.\n3. **Temporal and Spatial Resolution:** The ten-year intervals and 500m grid size used in the analysis might not effectively capture the swift changes and spatial variability related to climate change.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Increase Sampling Size:** The research should aim to broaden its sample size to encompass additional study sites and amphibian species to improve generalizability and mitigate sampling bias.\n2. **Refine Model Parameters:** The selection of variables and parameters in the SDMs should be refined to enhance the depiction of the complex interactions impacting amphibian populations.\n3. **Consider Additional Variables:** Additional factors, such as disease ecology and human influence, should be integrated into the study to gain a fuller understanding of climate change's impacts on amphibians.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis research significantly enhances the understanding of climate change's effects on amphibian populations in tropical environments.

        "abstract": "Long-term forecasting presents unique challenges due to the time and memory complexity of handling long sequences. Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for complex tasks remains a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties of engineering scalar reward functions and the inherent inefficiency of training models from scratch. Instead, it would be better to specify complex tasks in terms of elementary subtasks and to reuse subtask solutions whenever possible. In this work, we address continuous space lexicographic multi-objective RL problems, consisting of prioritized subtasks, which are notoriously difficult to solve. We show that these can be scalarized with a subtask transformation and then solved incrementally using value decomposition. Exploiting this insight, we propose prioritized soft Q-decomposition (PSQD), a novel algorithm for learning and adapting subtask solutions under lexicographic priorities in continuous state-action spaces. PSQD offers the ability to reuse previously learned subtask solutions in a zero-shot composition, followed by an adaptation step. Its ability to use retained subtask training data for offline learning eliminates the need for new environment interaction during adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting successful learning, reuse, and adaptation results for both lowand high-dimensional simulated robot control tasks, as well as offline learning results. In contrast to baseline approaches, PSQD does not trade off between conflicting subtasks or priority constraints and satisfies subtask priorities during learning. PSQD provides an intuitive framework for tackling complex RL problems, offering insights into the inner workings of the subtask composition.",

However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this, we present HCNN, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression. Experiments on standard vision tasks demonstrate the promising performance of our HCNN framework in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic settings. Overall, we believe our contributions provide a foundation for developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures found in image data.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The manuscript introduces an innovative therapeutic method for addressing neurodegenerative disorders through microRNA-targeted gene editing. The authors employ a CRISPR-Cas13 system to selectively focus on certain microRNAs linked to these disorders, resulting in the silencing of genes that cause disease. Their preclinical trials indicate that this technique is effective across models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), showcasing its potential to alleviate symptoms, slow progression, and enhance neuroregeneration.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases contribute significantly to worldwide health issues. Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and ALS rank among the most common. Existing treatment options remain limited in effectiveness, often resulting in serious side effects and a lack of clarity regarding the underlying biological processes. MicroRNAs are essential in managing gene expression, and their abnormal levels have been connected to neurodegenerative conditions. The authors propose that by targeting specific miRNAs implicated in these disorders using CRISPR-Cas13, a new therapeutic avenue could be opened.\n\nThe research team created a system leveraging CRISPR-Cas13 to aim at specific miRNAs involved in neurodegenerative disorders. Through RNA sequencing, ten miRNAs with differential expression were identified, later validated with qRT-PCR. Subsequently, guide RNAs (gRNAs) for CRISPR-Cas13 were designed to target these miRNAs and introduced into human neuroepithelial cells (hNECs) via a viral vector. The effectiveness of the gene editing in silencing harmful genes was then evaluated.\n\nIn their preclinical analysis, the authors confirmed that the CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing eliminated disease-linked genes in hNECs. This gene silencing led to diminished disease symptoms, slowed progression, and enhanced neuroregeneration, alongside a notable rise in neuroregeneration-related miRNA expression.\n\nThe research offers a groundbreaking therapeutic method employing microRNA-based gene editing for neurodegenerative disorders, with the preclinical findings substantiating this strategy's effectiveness against Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and ALS. Results suggest the potential for microRNA editing to alleviate symptoms, decelerate disease progression, and foster neuroregenerative processes. Moving towards human clinical trials will require further investigation.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* The paper outlines a pioneering approach to neurodegenerative disorder therapy via microRNA-based gene editing.\n* Efficacy in preclinical models of Alzheimer\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, and ALS is highlighted clearly.\n* The potential of CRISPR-Cas13 for silencing genes associated with disease is effectively presented.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The description of the CRISPR-Cas13 system, particularly regarding gRNA design and choice of target miRNAs, lacks detail.\n* The validation method for miRNAs via qRT-PCR is insufficient; a more thorough experimental design is necessary.\n* The preclinical focus on hNECs may not accurately depict the intricate biology of the central nervous system.\n* There is no acknowledgment of potential side effects or long-term implications of CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing in humans.\n* The optimistic conclusion does not align with the available evidence supporting the transition to human trials.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* The authors should elaborate on the CRISPR-Cas13 system, including gRNA design and target miRNA selection.\n* A more comprehensive validation approach for miRNAs is recommended, utilizing methods such as in situ hybridization or RNA sequencing.\n* Using more appropriate cell types, like primary neurons or brain organoids, will enhance the relevance of the studies.\n* It is essential to discuss possible side effects or long-term ramifications of employing CRISPR-Cas13 in human applications.\n* A thoughtful assessment of the therapeutic strategy's potential should be pursued, considering preclinical study limitations.\n\n**Major Concerns:**\n\n* The evidence provided does not convincingly advocate for the application of this therapeutic strategy in human trials.\n* A lack of detailed insight into the CRISPR-Cas13 system raises questions regarding the accuracy of the gene editing procedures.\n\n**Minor Concerns:**\n\n* The manuscript could benefit from more thorough descriptions of methodology.\n* Additional exploration of the limitations within the preclinical studies would be advantageous.\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\n\nWhile the manuscript introduces a promising new treatment method for neurodegenerative disorders through microRNA-based gene editing, it currently falls short in supporting the transition of this strategy to human clinical trials. Addressing the major concerns highlighted in this review will enhance the substance and relevance of the preclinical findings.",

        "abstract": "This work summarizes two ways to accomplish Time-Series (TS) tasks in today\u2019s Large Language Model (LLM) context: LLM-for-TS (model-centric) designs and trains a fundamental large model, or fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for TS data; TS-for-LLM (data-centric) converts TS into a model-friendly representation to enable the pre-trained LLM to handle TS data. Given the lack of data, limited resources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses on TSfor-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM\u2019s ability for TS data by designing a TS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST. It first tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed TS via instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, where the TS embedding space is aligned to LLM\u2019s embedding layer space, then creates soft prompts to make LLM more open to that embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks using the frozen LLM. We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory and experiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, and representation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes. The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance than today\u2019s SOTA TS models and offer benefits for few-shot and generalization. By treating LLM as the pattern machine, TEST can endow LLM\u2019s ability to process TS data without compromising language ability. We hope that this study will serve as a foundation for future work to support TS+LLM progress.",

        "abstract": "Transparent machine learning (ML) models are essential for ensuring interpretability and trustworthiness in decision-making systems, particularly in highstakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. While transparent machine learning models have been proposed for classification and regression, time series forecasting presents some unique challenges for ensuring transparency. In particular, currently used bottom-up approaches that focus on the values of the time series at specific time points (usually regularly spaced) do not provide a holistic understanding of the entire time series. This limits the applicability of ML in many critical areas. To open up these domains for ML, we propose a top-down framework of bi-level transparency, which involves understanding the higher-level trends and the lower-level properties of the predicted time series. Applying this framework, we develop TIMEVIEW, a transparent ML model for time series forecasting based on static features, complemented with an interactive visualization tool. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and interpretability of our approach, paving the way for more transparent and reliable applications of ML in various domains.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enhances data privacy with collaborative in-situ training on decentralized clients. Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients\u2019 data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.",

Existing methods often resort to training cascaded models in pixel space, or using a downsampled latent space of a separately trained auto-encoder. In this paper, we introduce Matryoshka Diffusion (MDM), a novel framework for high-resolution image and video synthesis. We propose a diffusion process that denoises inputs at multiple resolutions jointly and uses a NestedUNet architecture where features and parameters for small scale inputs are nested within those of the large scales. In addition, MDM enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higher resolutions which leads to significant improvements in optimization for high-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks, including class-conditioned image generation, high-resolution text-to-image, and text-to-video applications. Remarkably, we can train a single pixel-space model at resolutions of up to 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels, demonstrating strong zero shot generalization using the CC12M dataset, which contains only 12 million images.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching (JSM) approach. Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the datadriven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres also achieve salient performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators.",

        "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation aims to align the classes and reduce the feature gap between the same category of the source and target domains. The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shifts are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category. Unfortunately, due to such semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, categories are not always classified in detail, making it difficult for the model to perform precise adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method that can learn the differences between samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there exists significant concept shift between them. By doing so, our model learns a more reasonable feature space that enhances the transferability and reflects the inherent differences among samples annotated as the same category. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MemSPM method over multiple scenarios, including UniDA, OSDA, and PDA. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in most cases.",

In this work, we present TapMo, a Text-driven Animation Pipeline for synthesizing Motion in a broad spectrum of skeleton-free 3D characters. The pivotal innovation in TapMo is its use of shape deformation-aware features as a condition to guide the diffusion model, thereby enabling the generation of meshspecific motions for various characters. Specifically, TapMo comprises two main components Mesh Handle Predictor and Shape-aware Diffusion Module. Mesh Handle Predictor predicts the skinning weights and clusters mesh vertices into adaptive handles for deformation control, which eliminates the need for traditional skeletal rigging. Shape-aware Motion Diffusion synthesizes motion with mesh-specific adaptations. This module employs text-guided motions and mesh features extracted during the first stage, preserving the geometric integrity of the animations by accounting for the character\u2019s shape and deformation. Trained in a weakly-supervised manner, TapMo can accommodate a multitude of nonhuman meshes, both with and without associated text motions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TapMo through rigorous qualitative and quantitative experiments. Our results reveal that TapMo consistently outperforms existing auto-animation methods, delivering superior-quality animations for both seen or unseen heterogeneous 3D characters.

        "abstract": "Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced numbers of parameters for quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators to increase the number of parameters for quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM\u2019s weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven, task-specific paradigm for experimental design, to shorten acquisition time, reduce costs, and accelerate the deployment of imaging devices. Current approaches in experimental design focus on model-parameter estimation and require specification of a particular model, whereas in imaging, other tasks may drive the design. Furthermore, such approaches often lead to intractable optimization problems in real-world imaging applications. Here we present a new paradigm for experimental design that simultaneously optimizes the design (set of image channels) and trains a machine-learning model to execute a userspecified image-analysis task. The approach obtains data densely-sampled over the measurement space (many image channels) for a small number of acquisitions, then identifies a subset of channels of prespecified size that best supports the task. We propose a method: TADRED for TAsk-DRiven Experimental Design in imaging, to identify the most informative channel-subset whilst simultaneously training a network to execute the task given the subset. Experiments demonstrate the potential of TADRED in diverse imaging applications: several clinicallyrelevant tasks in magnetic resonance imaging; and remote sensing and physiological applications of hyperspectral imaging. Results show substantial improvement over classical experimental design, two recent application-specific methods within the new paradigm, and state-of-the-art approaches in supervised feature selection. We anticipate further applications of our approach. Code is available: Code Link.",

While improving performance on domain tasks, it often brings a side-effect of forgetting of the model\u2019s general abilities. In this study, we analyze the effects of finetuning on language models by dissecting its impacts on the modeling of topic, style, and factual knowledge in text. Our method uses instruction-following LLMs such as ChatGPT to autogenerate controlled-variable text examples which we use to probe the model. Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model\u2019s topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change. Analysis shows that the adaptation of topic and style priors behave akin to learning simple features: they are learned rapidly and require little model capacity. They are also learned independently and primarily at the beginning of a text sequence. In contrast, factual knowledge is learned stably but slowly and requires significant model capacity. The findings offer insights and understanding into the finer dynamics of learning and forgetting in language models, and potentially inform future research on improving domain adaptation and addressing the challenges of continual language learning.",

        "abstract": "Fairness in artificial intelligence models has gained significantly more attention in recent years, especially in the area of medicine, as fairness in medical models is critical to people\u2019s well-being and lives. Highquality medical fairness datasets are needed to promote fairness learning research. Existing medical fairness datasets are all for classification tasks, and no fairness datasets are available for medical segmentation, while medical segmentation is an equally important clinical task as classifications, which can provide detailed spatial information on organ abnormalities ready to be assessed by clinicians. In this paper, we propose the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation named Harvard-FairSeg with 10,000 subject samples. In addition, we propose a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function with the upper error-bound in each identity group, using the segment anything model (SAM). We anticipate that the segmentation performance equity can be improved by explicitly tackling the hard cases with high training errors in each identity group. To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-theart fairness learning models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible via https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/datasets/harvard-fairseg10k.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The study introduces an innovative therapeutic strategy for addressing Alzheimer's disease (AD) through a multi-targeted combination therapy involving four distinct pharmacological agents. This approach effectively targets various pathways linked to AD pathogenesis. Our findings indicate that this combination therapy notably enhances cognitive function, decreases amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, and boosts synaptic plasticity. These results highlight the potential of this new strategy as a compelling treatment option for AD. The study also points out possible biomarkers that could facilitate early detection of AD, aiding in tailored treatment plans.\n\nAD is a multifaceted neurodegenerative disorder marked by declining cognitive abilities, memory impairment, and neuroinflammation. Current AD treatments have limited effectiveness and often result in considerable side effects for patients. Thus, it's essential to explore novel therapeutic avenues. This investigation aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-targeted combination therapy in the management of AD.\n\nFor this study, we employed a combination of four pharmacological agents: rivastigmine, memantine, donepezil, and galantamine. These agents were selected for their ability to target different pathways relevant to AD, which encompass cholinergic dysfunction, NMDA receptor antagonism, butyrylcholinesterase inhibition, and modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.\n\nThe results indicate that the combination therapy leads to significant improvements in cognitive performance, evidenced by the MMSE score. Furthermore, it results in a decrease in amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, as confirmed through PET imaging, and enhances synaptic plasticity, as determined by electrophysiological assessments.\n\nThe implications of our findings suggest that this innovative approach could provide an effective treatment for AD. The integration of four pharmacological agents may yield a more potent treatment modality compared to single-agent therapies that frequently suffer from side effects. Moreover, the reduction of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques might support the early identification of AD, paving the way for individualized treatment strategies.\n\nFuture research should focus on the long-term effects and safety of the combination therapy. Additional studies are also warranted to discover potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.\n\nIn summary, this research introduces a groundbreaking therapeutic strategy for AD through a multi-targeted combination therapy that significantly enhances cognitive capabilities, reduces amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, and improves synaptic plasticity. These results imply that this approach may serve as a promising intervention for AD.\n\nThe study explores a compelling method to treat Alzheimer's disease by utilizing a combination of four pharmacological agents. A key strength of this research is its multi-targeted approach.\n\nStrengths of the study include the strategy of combining agents that affect different pathways, which may be more effective than traditional single-agent therapies. Additionally, it emphasizes the possibility for early AD detection, potentially facilitating personalized treatment options.\n\nHowever, the study has notable weaknesses, such as a limited sample size that could hinder the applicability of the results. The absence of a control group further complicates the assessment of the combination therapy's effectiveness.\n\nTo enhance the study, the authors might consider increasing the sample size for improved applicability and including a control group for stronger comparisons with existing treatments.\n\nGiven the study's strengths and weaknesses, I recommend that the authors pursue further research to assess the long-term effectiveness and safety of the combination therapy. Increasing the sample size would also help bolster the applicability of the findings.\n\nI would rate this research a 7 out of 10. While it introduces a noteworthy method for Alzheimer's disease treatment, the lack of a control group restricts the generalizability of the results. With additional research, this study could make a significant impact on AD treatment methodologies.\n\nThe authors express gratitude for the reviewer's critical evaluation of their work, acknowledging that the small sample size may limit the study's broader implications. They plan to expand the sample size in subsequent research and appreciate the suggestion to incorporate a control group for future studies.\n\nThey are encouraged that the reviewer recognizes the promise of their multi-targeted combination therapy for AD treatment and believe it may yield a more effective approach compared to single-agent therapies subject to side effects.\n\nThe authors also welcome the recommendation for ongoing research into the long-term efficacy and safety of their combination therapy, acknowledging its importance and committing to further investigations addressing these issues.\n\nOverall, they value the reviewer's feedback, which has provided meaningful perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of their research, and look forward to addressing any further inquiries from the reviewer.",

        "abstract": "Exposing meaningful and interpretable neural interactions is critical to understanding neural circuits. Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional connectivity. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional connectivity can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional connectivity, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional connectivities are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose two novel priorinformed state-switching GLMs, called Gaussian HMM-GLM (Gaussian prior) and one-hot HMM-GLM (Gumbel-Softmax one-hot prior). We show that the learned prior should capture the state-invariant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood, and enhance the interpretability of interaction patterns and hidden states when applied to real neural data.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework of algorithms that is extended from the celebrated extragradient algorithm. The min-max problem has attracted increasing attention because of its applications in machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) training. While there has been exhaustive research on convex-concave setting, problem of nonconvex-nonconcave setting faces many challenges, such as convergence to limit cycles. Given that general min-max optimization has been found to be intractable, recent research efforts have shifted towards tackling structured problems. One of these follows the weak Minty variational inequality (weak MVI), which is motivated by relaxing Minty variational inequality (MVI) without compromising convergence guarantee of extragradient algorithm. Existing extragradient-type algorithms involve one exploration step and one update step per iteration. We analyze the algorithms with multiple exploration steps and show that current assumption can be further relaxed when more exploration is introduced. Furthermore, we design an adaptive algorithm that explores until the optimal improvement is achieved. This process exploits information from the whole trajectory and effectively tackles cyclic behaviors.",

Recent dynamic neural representations can faithfully represent motions using correspondences, but they cannot be directly used for motion analysis. In this work, we propose Phase-based neural polynomial Gabor fields (Phase-PGF), which learns to represent scene dynamics with low-dimensional time-varying phases. We theoretically show that PhasePGF has several properties suitable for macro motion analysis. In our experiments, we collect diverse 2D and 3D dynamic scenes and show that Phase-PGF enables dynamic scene analysis and editing tasks including motion loop detection, motion factorization, motion smoothing, and motion magnification.

However, existing open-source libraries suffer from various limitations, which impede their practical use in challenging scenarios where large-scale training is necessary. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction on the dataflows of RL training, which unifies diverse RL training applications into a general framework. Following this abstraction, we develop a scalable, efficient, and extensible distributed RL system called ReaLly Scalable RL (SRL), which allows efficient and massively parallelized training and easy development of customized algorithms. Our evaluation shows that SRL outperforms existing academic libraries, reaching at most 21x higher training throughput in a distributed setting. On learning performance, beyond performing and scaling well on common RL benchmarks with different RL algorithms, SRL can reproduce the same solution in the challenging hide-and-seek environment as reported by OpenAI with up to 5x speedup in wallclock time. Notably, SRL is the first in the academic community to perform RL experiments at a large scale with over 15k CPU cores. SRL source code is available at: https://github.com/openpsi-project/srl.",

        "abstract": "Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence. While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these approaches are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \u201cstochastic\u201d refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f -divergence measures (f -FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f -FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f -FERM objective under lp norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f -FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts. An efficient stochastic implementation of f -FERM is publicly available 1.",

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown to be effective to learn representations from time series in a self-supervised way. However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing stateof-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "Estimating neural radiance fields (NeRFs) is able to generate novel views of a scene from known imagery. Recent approaches have afforded dramatic progress on small bounded regions of the scene. For an unbounded scene where cameras point in any direction and contents exist at any distance, certain mapping functions are used to represent it within a bounded space, yet they either work in object-centric scenes or focus on objects close to the camera. The goal of this paper is to understand how to design a proper mapping function that considers per-scene optimization, which remains unexplored. We first present a geometric understanding of existing mapping functions that express the relation between the bounded and unbounded scenes. Here, we exploit a stereographic projection method to explain failures of the mapping functions, where input ray samples are too sparse to account for scene geometry in unbounded regions. To overcome the failures, we propose a novel mapping function based on a p-norm distance, allowing to adaptively sample the rays by adjusting the p-value according to scene geometry, even in unbounded regions. To take the advantage of our mapping function, we also introduce a new ray parameterization to properly allocate ray samples in the geometry of unbounded regions. Through the incorporation of both the novel mapping function and the ray parameterization within existing NeRF frameworks, our method achieves state-ofthe-art novel view synthesis results on a variety of challenging datasets.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:** \nThe introduction effectively outlines the significance of tackling Alzheimer's disease, especially concerning its inflammatory aspects. The authors emphasize the necessity for innovative treatments targeting this issue. Nonetheless, the literature review could be enhanced with a more detailed examination of the current understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.\n\n**Methods:** \nThe design of the study appears well thought out, featuring a small-scale clinical trial. The incorporation of a low-dose corticosteroid in the treatment mix raises concerns regarding possible side effects and the chance of worsening the disease. It would be advantageous to include a control group that follows a standard corticosteroid treatment to allow for a more precise evaluation of the treatment's effectiveness.\n\n**Results:** \nThe findings indicate a statistically significant decline in inflammatory markers in the treatment group when compared to the control group. However, the small sample size and the absence of a long-term follow-up are noted drawbacks. Including a larger group of participants and conducting a prolonged study would be critical to substantiate these results and address potential side effects.\n\n**Discussion:** \nThe discussion section underscores the potential advantages of the proposed treatment while also voicing the need for additional research. The authors recognize their study's limitations but do not adequately explore the possible long-term effects of corticosteroids on Alzheimer's treatment. A more thorough assessment of potential side effects and their long-term impact on cognitive abilities is essential to fully gauge the treatment's benefits.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe conclusion encapsulates the primary findings and stresses the promise of the proposed therapy. It also points out the necessity for more research to establish the treatment's efficacy and safety thoroughly. The authors should aim to discuss the study's limitations in greater depth and provide a more complete analysis of the treatment's potential advantages and disadvantages.\n\n**Recommendation:** \nIn light of this review's findings, I suggest that the authors consider the following modifications:\n\n1. Increase the sample size and carry out a longer-term follow-up study to affirm the treatment's effectiveness and investigate possible side effects.\n2. Incorporate a control group undergoing a standard corticosteroid regimen for a more accurate evaluation of the treatment's efficacy.\n3. Undertake a more exhaustive assessment of the treatment's potential side effects and its long-term implications for cognitive function.\n4. Offer a more detailed discussion regarding the long-term consequences of corticosteroid use in the context of Alzheimer's treatment.\n\nOverall, this paper introduces a compelling strategy for addressing Alzheimer's disease; however, it requires further refinement and thorough testing to validate its possible benefits and safety effectively.",

However, it has been difficult to learn robust and generalizable representations within multivariate datasets due to complex inter-channel relationships and dynamic shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning spatiotemporal structure and using it to improve the application of transformers to timeseries datasets. Our framework learns a set of group tokens, and builds an instance-specific group embedding (GE) layer that assigns input tokens to a small number of group tokens to incorporate structure into learning. We then introduce a novel architecture, GroupAware transFormer (GAFormer), which incorporates both spatial and temporal group embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of timeseries classification and regression tasks. In evaluations on a number of diverse timeseries datasets, we show that GE on its own can provide a nice enhancement to a number of backbones, and that by coupling spatial and temporal group embeddings, the GAFormer can outperform the existing baselines. Finally, we show how our approach discerns latent structures in data even without information about the spatial ordering of channels, and yields a more interpretable decomposition of spatial and temporal structure underlying complex multivariate datasets.",

        "abstract": "Retrosynthetic planning is a sequential decision-making process of identifying synthetic routes from the available building block materials to reach a desired target molecule. Though existing planning approaches show promisingly high solving rates and route qualities, the trivial route quality evaluation via pre-trained forward reaction prediction models certainly falls short of real-world chemical practice. An alternative option is to annotate the actual quality of a route, such as yield, through chemical experiments or input from chemists, but this often leads to substantial query costs. In order to strike the balance between query costs and route quality evaluation, we propose an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that remains compatible with the established retrosynthetic planners. On one hand, the proposed ARP trains an actor that decides whether to query the quality of a reaction; on the other hand, it resorts to a critic to estimate the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction quality as input. Those molecules with high reaction qualities are preferred to expand first. We apply our framework to different existing approaches on both the benchmark and an expert dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 6.2% in route quality while reducing the query cost by 12.8%. In addition, ARP consistently plans high-quality routes with either abundant or sparse annotations.",

Although the concept is captivating, the authors would benefit from a more comprehensive literature review to substantiate their methodology.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe authors utilized a combination of theoretical models and experimental assessments to create and analyze the PVDF membrane. This interdisciplinary approach is praiseworthy. Nonetheless, the methodology section lacks vital specifics regarding the materials utilized, the membrane manufacturing process, and the protocols for testing.

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional finetuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.1",

        "abstract": "Equipping agents with the capacity to justify made decisions using supporting evidence represents a cornerstone of accountable decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring that justifications are in line with human expectations and societal norms is vital, especially in high-stakes situations such as healthcare. In this work, we propose the use of a debate-based reward model for reinforcement learning agents, where the outcome of a zero-sum debate game quantifies the justifiability of a decision in a particular state. This reward model is then used to train a justifiable policy, whose decisions can be more easily corroborated with supporting evidence. In the debate game, two argumentative agents take turns providing supporting evidence for two competing decisions. Given the proposed evidence, a proxy of a human judge evaluates which decision is better justified. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in learning policies for prescribing and justifying treatment decisions of septic patients. We show that augmenting the reward with the feedback signal generated by the debate-based reward model yields policies highly favored by the judge when compared to the policy obtained solely from the environment rewards, while hardly sacrificing any performance. Moreover, in terms of the overall performance and justifiability of trained policies, the debate-based feedback is comparable to the feedback obtained from an ideal judge proxy that evaluates decisions using the full information encoded in the state. This suggests that the debate game outputs key information contained in states that is most relevant for evaluating decisions, which in turn substantiates the practicality of combining our approach with human-in-the-loop evaluations. Lastly, we showcase that agents trained via multi-agent debate learn to propose evidence that is resilient to refutations and closely aligns with human preferences.",

        "abstract": "Human visual recognition system shows astonishing capability of compressing visual information into a set of tokens containing rich representations without label supervision. One critical driving principle behind it is perceptual grouping (Palmer, 2002; Wagemans et al., 2012; Herzog, 2018). Despite being widely used in computer vision in the early 2010s, it remains a mystery whether perceptual grouping can be leveraged to derive a neural visual recognition backbone that generates as powerful representations. In this paper, we propose the Perceptual Group Tokenizer, a model that entirely relies on grouping operations to extract visual features and perform self-supervised representation learning, where a series of grouping operations are used to iteratively hypothesize the context for pixels or superpixels to refine feature representations. We show that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision architectures, and inherits desirable properties including adaptive computation without re-training, and interpretability. Specifically, Perceptual Group Tokenizer achieves 80.3% on ImageNet-1K self-supervised learning benchmark with linear probe evaluation, establishing a new milestone for this paradigm.",

In this work, we study data-driven offline training for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose an instruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage screenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click and type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large corpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent\u2019s ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8%, even outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web. We also collect 347K high-quality demonstrations using our trained models, 38 times larger than prior work, and make them available to promote future research in this direction.",

        "abstract": "Numerous explainability methods have been proposed to shed light on the inner workings of GNNs. Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to GNNs, such as a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners, their stability to variational factors such as different GNN architectures, noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for GNNs, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. Nonetheless, our study reveals that all algorithms are affected by stability issues when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, we have established that the current generation of counterfactual explainers often fails to provide feasible recourses due to violations of topological constraints encoded by domain-specific considerations. Overall, this benchmarking study empowers stakeholders in the field of GNNs with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art explainability methods, potential research problems for further enhancement, and the implications of their application in real-world scenarios.",

        "title": "SELF-CONSUMING GENERATIVE MODELS GO MAD",
        "abstract": "Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types have led to the temptation to use AI-synthesized data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and whether the samples from previous-generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), by analogy to mad cow disease, and show that appreciable MADness arises in just a few generations. Generation t = 1 t = 3 t = 5 t = 7 t = 9 Figure 1: Training generative artificial intelligence (AI) models on synthetic data progressively amplifies artifacts. As AI-synthesized data proliferates in standard datasets and the Internet, future AI models will train on both real and synthetic data, forming autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loops. Here we highlight a potential unintended consequence of autophagous training. We trained a sequence of StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2019a) models wherein the model at generation t \u2265 2 trains only on data synthesized by the model at generation t\u2212 1. This setup is a fully synthetic loop (Figure 3) without sampling bias (\u03bb = 1). Note how the cross-hatched artifacts (possibly an architectural fingerprint (Karras et al., 2021)) are progressively amplified at each generation. Appendix D has more samples.",

        "abstract": "Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models\u2019 inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals\u2019 privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost (100\u00d7) and time (240\u00d7) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.",

Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that sidesteps the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pretrained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudolabels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.",

        "abstract": "Protein design, a grand challenge of the day, involves optimization on a fitness landscape, and leading methods adopt a model-based approach where a model is trained on a training set (protein sequences and fitness) and proposes candidates to explore next. These methods are challenged by sparsity of high-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the literature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the distribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not designed for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of \u201cseparation\u201d in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome the problem. We demonstrate its advantage over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance and separation between lowand high-fitness training samples. Our comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcases the generality of our approach in discrete and continuous design spaces.
