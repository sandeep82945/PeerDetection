        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

        "abstract": "We present MovingParts, a NeRF-based method for dynamic scene reconstruction and part discovery. We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "**Peer Review:**\n\n**Title:** Examining the Impact of Microplastics on Soil Microbial Communities\n\n**Summary:**\nThis research examines how microplastics affect the diversity and structure of microbial communities in soil environments. The authors utilized both laboratory and field studies to evaluate the effects of various types and concentrations of microplastics on microbial growth and community composition. The results indicate that specific types and levels of microplastic exposure can adversely impact microbial communities, underscoring the necessity for additional studies on the environmental consequences of plastic pollution.\n\n**Method Section:**\n\n1. **Materials and Methods:** The researchers employed laboratory and field investigations to understand the influence of microplastics on microbial ecosystems. They created three distinct soil types (organic-rich, sandy, and loamy) and introduced varying concentrations (0%, 1%, 5%, and 10%) of polystyrene and polyethylene particles. These soil samples were later incubated under controlled conditions, and microbial communities were examined through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.\n2. **Experimental Design:** A 30-day incubation study was performed where soils were subjected to different types and levels of microplastics. Additionally, they conducted a field study by collecting surface soil samples from 10 polluted locations and 10 unpolluted areas.\n3. **Data Analysis:** The microbial communities present in the soils were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The researchers assessed the diversity and composition of these microbial communities across various treatments compared to control groups.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe findings indicate that exposure to certain types and levels of microplastics can adversely affect microbial communities. Specifically, polystyrene particles exhibited a marked negative impact on microbial diversity, while polyethylene showed a more muted effect. The field study identified significant variations in microbial community composition between the polluted and unpolluted sites. These outcomes highlight the extensive implications of plastic pollution on ecosystem health and the importance of further investigation into its environmental effects.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Small sample sizes:** The field study's limited sample size may not reflect broader ecological patterns.\n2. **Environmental factors control:** Uncontrolled environmental variables such as temperature, moisture, and nutrient levels that could influence microbial communities were not accounted for.\n3. **Assumption of representativeness:** The assumption that the microbial communities in the studied soils reflect those in the larger ecosystem may not hold true, as microbial diversity can differ greatly based on location, climate, and other influencing factors.\n\n**Main Findings:**\n\n1. Certain types and concentrations of microplastics negatively affect microbial diversity.\n2. Polystyrene particles significantly diminish microbial diversity, while polyethylene particles have a less pronounced impact.\n3. The field study shows a notable difference in microbial community structure between polluted and unpolluted regions.\n4. Plastic pollution poses significant risks to the health of ecosystems.",
