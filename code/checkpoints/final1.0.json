        "title": "CAUSAL MODELLING AGENTS: CAUSAL GRAPH DIS-",
        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

        "title": "LANGUAGE-INFORMED VISUAL CONCEPT LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",
