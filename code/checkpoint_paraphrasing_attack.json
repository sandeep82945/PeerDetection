        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

In practice, one might encounter explanations which lack informativeness or contradict visual-grounded facts, known as implausibility and hallucination problems, respectively. To tackle these challenging issues, we consider the task of visual question answering (VQA) and introduce Rapper, a two-stage Reinforced RationalePrompted Paradigm. By knowledge distillation, the former stage of Rapper infuses rationale-prompting via large language models (LLMs), encouraging the rationales supported by language-based facts. As for the latter stage, a unique Reinforcement Learning from NLE Feedback (RLNF) is introduced for injecting visual facts into NLE generation.

        "abstract": "We present MovingParts, a NeRF-based method for dynamic scene reconstruction and part discovery. We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

Utilizing both laboratory and field experiments, the authors assessed the effects of various types and concentrations of microplastics on microbial growth and diversity. The results indicate that certain microplastic types and concentrations adversely affect microbial communities, underscoring the importance of further studies regarding the environmental repercussions of plastic pollution.\n\n**Method Section:**\n\n1. **Materials and Methods:** The authors combined laboratory and field experiments to study microplastic effects on microbial communities. They prepared three different soil types (organic-rich, sandy, and loamy) and introduced various concentrations (0%, 1%, 5%, and 10%) of polystyrene and polyethylene particles. The soils were incubated under controlled conditions, and microbial communities were examined using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing.\n2. **Experimental Design:** A 30-day incubation experiment was conducted, exposing soils to varied concentrations and types of microplastics. Soil samples were taken at 0, 5, 10, and 15 days to evaluate microbial community structure and diversity.\n3. **Data Analysis:** The authors analyzed the 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences with QIIME software to assess microbial diversity and community composition, employing ANOVA and Tukey's HSD tests for statistical comparisons among different treatments.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe research concludes that certain types and concentrations of microplastics negatively impact microbial communities, characterized by significant reductions in diversity and increases in specific microbial species' abundance. These effects appear to depend on the microplastic type, concentration, and soil type. The study emphasizes the necessity for further exploration of plastic pollution's environmental impacts and its potential threats to ecosystem health.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n1. **Experimental Design:** The study involved a limited number of treatments and replicates, which may not adequately reflect the full spectrum of potential impacts on microbial communities.\n2. **Soil Type:** Only three soil types were tested, which may not encompass the variety of conditions that microbial communities might face in the environment.\n3. **Microplastic Type:** The research focused on polystyrene and polyethylene, while other types of microplastics might influence microbial communities differently.\n4. **Duration:** Conducted over a relatively brief period (30 days), the study may not capture the long-term effects of microplastic exposure on microbial communities.\n\n**Main Findings:**\n\n1. **Effects on Microbial Diversity:** The research revealed that certain microplastics significantly reduce microbial diversity.\n2. **Community Composition Changes:** It was found that exposure to specific microplastics increases the abundance of particular microbial species.\n3. **Soil Variability:** The impact of microplastics on microbial communities varied based on the type and concentration of plastics in different soil types.\n4. **Long-term Implications:** The study highlights potential lasting effects of microplastic exposure on microbial communities, reinforcing the need for additional research into the broader environmental consequences of plastic pollution.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test.

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "The paper offers an extensive exploration of social media's influence on the characteristics of online communities. Nevertheless, the study's findings come with certain limitations that should be taken into account when interpreting the results.\n\nThe authors utilize a mixed-methods approach that combines survey research with content analysis. Although this method is appropriate for delving into the intricate effects of social media on communities, the survey's sample size is relatively modest (n = 500). A larger sample could have yielded more robust and generalizable results. Additionally, the reliance on self-reported measures may introduce biases.\n\nStatistical techniques are employed to investigate the connections between social media engagement, community formation, social interactions, and community cohesion. However, the findings from this analysis are somewhat conflicted; some results point to a significant relationship between social media and community formation, while others show no considerable impact on community cohesion. This inconsistency raises concerns about the reliability of the conclusions drawn.\n\nThe authors reference theoretical perspectives from social network theory, community psychology, and communication studies to explore the relationship between social media and communities. While these theories are pertinent, their application appears oversimplified. For instance, the authors posit that social media usage directly causes changes in community characteristics, overlooking other potential factors that could play a role.\n\nThe conclusion drawn is that social media considerably influences the attributes of online communities, mainly in terms of community formation and social interactions. However, due to the ambiguous nature of the findings, it becomes challenging to reach definitive conclusions. Moreover, the authors fail to address the potential ramifications of their findings for social media enterprises, policymakers, or community organizers.\n\nFuture research should seek to mitigate the limitations identified in this study by amplifying the sample size, employing more reliable measures of social media usage, and exploring alternative theoretical models that reflect the complexities of social media's influence on communities. It would also be valuable to investigate the implications of these findings for stakeholders like social media companies, policymakers, and community leaders.\n\nThis peer review delivers constructive criticism of the paper, acknowledging both its strengths and its shortcomings. Although the authors conduct a thorough examination of social media's effects on communities, the subsequent results present some ambiguity, necessitating careful consideration of the study's limitations when interpreting the outcomes.",

        "abstract": "While artificial intelligence has made remarkable strides in revealing the relationship between biological macromolecules\u2019 primary sequence and tertiary structure, designing RNA sequences based on specified tertiary structures remains challenging. Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both clusterlevel and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks.

The innovative use of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) to transport anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors to affected areas presents a promising therapeutic avenue. Nonetheless, the manuscript could be enhanced with additional refinement and development to harness the full potential of this method.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe methodology employed is generally robust, featuring a clearly outlined experimental design. The selection of a mouse model of neuroinflammation is appropriate, and the authors effectively differentiate between the impacts of MSCs and the control group. However, I would have appreciated more comprehensive details about the MSCs' preparation and characterization, specifically their surface markers and differentiation abilities. Furthermore, elaboration on the dosing protocol and administration specifics, including routes and treatment frequency, would enrich the study.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results align well with anticipated outcomes of MSC therapy, demonstrating that MSCs can successfully mitigate inflammation and facilitate neuroregeneration in the neuroinflammation mouse model. Still, I would have preferred a more in-depth statistical analysis along with detailed data concerning the effects of MSC therapy over various time points. Additionally, a broader exploration of the long-term impacts of MSC treatment, including the effects of repeated cycles and treatment duration, would be beneficial.\n\n**Discussions:**\nThe discussion section is generally well-articulated and accessible. Nevertheless, I would have liked to see a more thorough critique of the results, particularly regarding the approach's limitations and the necessity for further investigation. The authors might also consider elaborating on the implications of their findings for treating neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. Lastly, more context on the translational significance of their results, including the possibility of clinical trials and the need for further research to unlock the therapeutic potential of this approach, would be advantageous.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI recommend that the authors revise and resubmit the manuscript. While it presents a clear and encouraging approach to treating neuroinflammation, it would benefit from additional development and refinement to fully capitalize on the therapeutic possibilities of MSC therapy. The authors should provide further details on MSC preparation and characterization, including their surface marker profiles and differentiation capabilities, as well as more information on dosing and administration protocols. A comprehensive analysis of the long-term effects of MSC therapy and a discourse on the implications for treating neuroinflammatory disorders are also suggested.\n\n**Rating:** 6.5/10\n\n**Recommendation for Publication:**\nI would suggest considering this paper for publication in a prestigious, peer-reviewed journal specializing in stem cell biology or regenerative medicine. The manuscript outlines a promising approach to neuroinflammation treatment, contributing significantly to the field of MSC therapy. However, further refinement and development are necessary to fully utilize the therapeutic potential of MSCs.",

We introduce SWAP, a formulation of Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) for pruning, capitalizing on the geometric properties of the optimal transport problem. The \u201cswap\u201d of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost. The unique strength of SWAP is its intrinsic ability to balance noise reduction and covariance information preservation effectively. Extensive experiments performed on various networks and datasets show comparable performance of SWAP with state-of-the-art (SoTA) network pruning algorithms. Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks. Notably, our proposed method achieves a gain of 6% improvement in accuracy and 8% improvement in testing loss for MobileNetV1 with less than one-fourth of the network parameters remaining.",

        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of reducing the number of trainable parameters in deep transformer networks, we employ Reinforcement Learning to dynamically select layers during training and tie them together. Every few iterations, the RL agent is asked whether to train each layer i independently or to copy the weights of a previous layer j < i. This facilitates weight sharing, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and also serves as an effective regularization technique. Experimental evaluations validate that our model modestly outperforms the baseline transformer model with regard to perplexity and drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. In particular, the memory consumption during training is up to one order of magnitude less than the conventional training method.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "I have thoroughly reviewed the paper titled \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" authored by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. John Lee, and Dr. Emily Chen. In this evaluation, I will analyze the methodology, findings, and overall contributions of the paper to the discourse surrounding climate change and food security.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe authors performed an extensive review of empirical research concerning the impact of climate change on global food security, sourced from 25 peer-reviewed articles and 15 grey literature documents. They organized these findings into three primary themes: (1) the effects of climate change on crop yields, (2) its effects on agricultural productivity, and (3) its influence on food price fluctuations. Employing a mixed methods strategy, the authors combined both quantitative and qualitative analyses to explore the connections among climate change, food security, and economic factors.\n\nAlthough the authors' evidence review is comprehensive, I have concerns about their source selection. Their heavy reliance on peer-reviewed literature may restrict the scope of their findings. Furthermore, the lack of detailed descriptions of the grey literature makes it challenging to assess the trustworthiness and relevance of these materials.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe findings indicate that climate change significantly affects global food security, manifesting as lower crop yields, diminished agricultural productivity, and greater food price volatility. Key contributing elements identified include elevated temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and the rising occurrence of extreme weather events.\n\nWhile the results align with existing research, they fail to introduce any new insights or fresh viewpoints. The review predominantly reiterates established knowledge, with the authors\u2019 analysis lacking depth or innovation.\n\n**Contributions:**\n\nThe review serves as a thorough summary of the empirical research on climate change's impact on global food security. However, the overall contributions to the field are somewhat constrained. The authors do not propose any novel theoretical frameworks or policy suggestions, mainly focusing on recapitulating established information.\n\nIn summary, \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. John Lee, and Dr. Emily Chen offers a solid review of the empirical data. Nonetheless, the limitations in their source selection and the absence of innovative analysis diminish its contributions to the field. I recommend the authors revise the paper to address these shortcomings and incorporate more in-depth and original perspectives on the relationship between climate change and global food security.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Suggestions for Revision:**\n\n* Broaden the review by incorporating additional grey literature and a more diverse array of empirical research.\n* Create a more complex and innovative examination of the links between climate change, food security, and economic indicators.\n* Introduce new theoretical frameworks or policy suggestions to mitigate the effects of climate change on global food security.\n* Clarify and better organize the methodology, results, and discussion sections of the paper.\n* Include more case studies or illustrative examples to demonstrate the practical implications of the findings.",

        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "This research examines how different temperature conditions influence the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams, produced through a reaction-based method where urea-based polyol reactants are combined with isocyanates and a catalyst. The study tested four temperature conditions: ambient (20\u00b0C), moderate (30\u00b0C), high (40\u00b0C), and extreme (50\u00b0C). Findings show that foam yield varies significantly with temperature, peaking at 30\u00b0C, which the authors identify as the optimal temperature for production.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\nThe paper provides valuable insights into the impact of temperature on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams, employing an efficient reaction-based production method. The conclusion detailing 30\u00b0C as the ideal temperature for foam production adds meaningful information to the renewable materials field.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThe relevance of exploring temperature effects on bio-based polyurethane foam yield is important within renewable materials research. The reaction-based production method enhances efficiency compared to conventional techniques. Highlighting 30\u00b0C as the optimal temperature offers a beneficial contribution to the discipline.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nA notable limitation is the small sample size, as only four temperature conditions and four foams were tested. This could undermine the generalizability of the findings regarding bio-based polyurethane foams. Additionally, the paper lacks in-depth information about the foam properties, including density, compressive strength, or thermal insulation capabilities.\n\n**Recommendations for Enhancement:**\nTo improve the research, the authors should consider increasing the sample size to encompass a broader range of temperature conditions or foam types for a more thorough understanding of temperature's effect on yield. They could also perform an extensive analysis of foam characteristics, including density, compressive strength, and thermal insulation properties.\n\n**Critical Observations:**\nThe claim that 30\u00b0C is the optimal temperature for creating bio-based polyurethane foams stems from limited experimental conditions, which may not reflect the wider population of these materials, as optimal conditions could differ by application or industry. Furthermore, the study lacks details regarding the catalyst used and the types of polyol or isocyanates involved, which are significant factors in determining foam yield.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nWhile this study enhances our understanding of how temperature affects the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams, the findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the limited sample size. Increasing the sample size and offering detailed analyses of foam properties, along with further information on materials used, could significantly bolster the study\u2019s contributions to developing more efficient bio-based polyurethane foam production methods.\n\n**Score:**\nI rate this study as 7 out of 10. It offers important perspectives on the temperature effects on bio-based polyurethane foam yield, though the limitations of the small sample size hinder its potential impact. With further enhancements, the research could make a more substantial contribution to renewable materials science.",
